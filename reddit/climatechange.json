And last year basically all the stone fruits got messed up because of an \u2018early\u2019 spring. We had an intense, cold start with leaves frozen to branches followed by warm weather that created buds that then froze and died. Horrible crop of cherries. \n\n\nParked a trailer at a cherry orchard in October.  The owner of several acres that hosts orchard tours said he picked one ice cream bucket off his entire field and had no visitors. Made no money this recent summer and was relying on using his available parking space to generate a little cash flow. \n\nThere\u2019s another cherry orchard that has been completely cut down in the last month as well."

The range is 8,900 km (5,530 mi) long and 200 to 700 km (124 to 435 mi) wide (widest between 18\u00b0S and 20\u00b0S latitude) and has an average height of about 4,000 m (13,123 ft). The Andes extend from South to North through seven South American countries: Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela."

There needs to be a high percentage of the American public that supports a Presidential emergency declaration.

Meteorologists\u00a0[have even begun to speculate](https://x.com/webberweather/status/1843282756266287549)\u00a0that Milton could approach the theoretical maximum intensity for a hurricane in the Atlantic basin of 195 mph, challenging the record set by Hurricane Allen in 1980.\n\n  \nBut this hurricane isn\u2019t even happening in isolation. The one-two punch from Helene and Milton is what climatologists call a \u201ccompound event.\u201d With little to no time to prepare between landfalls, human misery becomes greater than the sum of the two storms separately.

The house on Gulf Way that his dad had built from a Sears Roebuck kit had all the living space on the second floor and open pilings underneath. He remembers going under the house before the storm, to open the seacocks of the boat they stored under the house so it would swamp rather than float away. The house survived the storm. Unfortunately, that building has since had the space on the round level turned into dwelling space. I don\u2019t think it fared well in Helene, nor will it have much to hope for if Milton hits. Maybe the huge berm of sand they plowed off the street and left in a long pile on the seaward side of Gulf Way might act as a buffer in best case, or the front of a plow in the worst case.\ud83d\ude29"

If you recall, they also showed that all industry leaders run around pouring nuclear waste everywhere because it was fun to them. \n\nThe reality is that businesses have gone into questionable production and business practices because it is the cheapest option. And because it is the cheapest option, many consumers choose it without a second thought. \n\nI love the environment and want it to continue. But the truth is that all consumers need to take a look in the mirror. Take single use plastic bags for instance. When rules were made about that, who got mad? The consumer.

So, these countries are increasingly locked in a spiral of responding to the last climate disaster at the cost of being better prepared for the next.\n\nHistory shows that periods of instability and crisis can provide fertile ground for rapid, positive change.\n\nThe conditions for doom loops also provide opportunities to accelerate virtuous circles. For example, out of the crises of the interwar period and the devastation of the second world war came legal protections for human rights, universal welfare systems and decolonisation. More recently, the first Trump administration spurred new waves of climate activism.\u201d"

Natura 2000 is a concerting tool for environmental discussions which helps bring ecological solutions to economical actors like farmers, loggers, hunters, etc. With these funds gone, they have no way to assure an ecological transition and we are seeing these wetlands drained and disappearing now even with 30 or so associations making a legal stand to protect it since it also means we can get fined by the European commissions for biodiversity. Without governmental funds, there is not much we can do right now... Which is what republicans will probably reciprocate x100. Good luck America, you will need it."

My dad is an Argentinian immigrant who's family still remains there. My uncle who voted for him has lost faith as it has only gotten harder to pay for housing and groceries there, along with many other supporters who are finally starting to be fed up with his project (his approval dropped 15% in September alone). One can hope the same will happen with Trump's support, though that is likely just the optimistic part of me."

Hence making the ocean more acidic and less able to support life. Acid produces H ions, which make it harder for shellfish to make shells. Think what DDT did to eggshells, particularly Eagles. Acidification also interferes with phytoplankton, the oxygen producers in the oceans. Less dissolved oxygen in the water, less fish, leads to an ecosystem collapse. Taking wolves out of yellowstone years ago had the same affect, herbivores grazed without moving because there was no threat from the wolves, riverbanks were severely overgrazed and rains caused soil erosion into the waterways driving away the fish. Then beavers left, birds of prey left and the downward spiral continued. Wolves were reintroduced and the ecosystem is now well on the way to recovery."

                "Content": "Yes, this is an extinction that could have been prevented. We were just too self-centered and lazy.\n\nBut it IS the 6th mass extinction on this planet. There have been 5 mass extinctions before. The previous one paved the way for us. \n\nI think that we can fairly say that we will erase the results of the last 66 million years of evolution. And we\u2019re wiping out all the beauty on this planet in the form of mammals. They weren\u2019t as dominant during the previous evolutionary period.\n\nAnd the comet and stuff wiped out all evolution that happened between 201 and 66 million years ago.\n\nYes, we have the same effect on our environment as a f* comet from outer space crashing into our planet.\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe fifth mass extinction, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, occurred about 66 million years ago. This event famously led to the extinction of approximately 75% of Earth\u2019s species, including the non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nThe extinction is widely believed to have been caused by a combination of catastrophic events, most notably the impact of a large asteroid or comet in what is now the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico (Chicxulub impact), along with volcanic activity and climate changes. This event dramatically altered Earth\u2019s ecosystems and paved the way for the rise of mammals, eventually leading to the dominance of humans.\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe fourth mass extinction is known as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, which occurred about 201 million years ago. This extinction event marked the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods and wiped out around 70-80% of all species on Earth.\n\nThe causes of the Triassic-Jurassic extinction are thought to include massive volcanic eruptions from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), which released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, leading to severe climate changes, such as global warming and ocean acidification. This extinction paved the way for the rise of dinosaurs, which dominated the Jurassic period following the event."

Go to any city and you'll see dozens of species that are, by chance, extremely well adapted to life alongside extremely dense and dynamic human populations. But the concept that avian biodiversity will continue to collapse to the point of there only being a couple hundred wild species worldwide is valid.\u00a0\n\n\nLuckily it's a self regulating system, because there being billions of birds of very few species living in proximity to humans will give us turbo pandemics for the rest of time. Anything that kills those birds that are left will kill us as well."

                "Content": "Good point. \n\nThe problem is: we do not know where we are. The speed of this climate change is unprecedented. \n\nYes, flora and fauna are adaptable and can migrate over tens or hundreds of generations. But we have already decimated their numbers and habitats to a fraction of what they were a few generations ago. \n\nThis means that their adaptability is greatly reduced. Migrating becomes practically impossible because of human infrastructure all over the place. Habitat fragmentation is a real problem for animals. \n\nAnd the speed at which the climate is changing has never happened before. We are in uncharted waters.\n\nThat is why many people are saying: if we don\u2019t slow down or halt climate change, we may vastly underestimate the number of species that do not have the time to adapt or migrate.\n\n\u2014-\nFauna loss in terms of numbers (not species):\n\nSince 1900, it is estimated that the world has lost around 60% of vertebrate fauna populations. This includes mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. This alarming decline is primarily due to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and climate change. Some estimates suggest that the overall rate of biodiversity loss could be higher when considering invertebrates and microorganisms, but specific percentages for all fauna types are harder to quantify.\n\nThe decline is often referred to as the \u201csixth mass extinction,\u201d and it\u2019s happening at a much faster rate than in past mass extinction events.\n\n\u2014-\n\nSince 1900, it is estimated that human infrastructure has directly altered or occupied around 75% of Earth\u2019s natural habitats. This includes urbanization, agriculture, roads, and other types of development. Forests, wetlands, grasslands, and other ecosystems have been converted to meet human needs, leading to significant habitat fragmentation and loss.\n\nThe expansion of agriculture alone is responsible for much of this change, as it now covers about 40% of the planet\u2019s land surface. Urban areas are also expanding rapidly, especially in the last few decades, contributing to the decline of natural spaces."

In fact in can be argued it\u2019s happened 6 separate times within the Theropod lineage. Besides early examples seen with Gallimimus (but it\u2019s not clear if any of them flew) most feathered wing dinosaurs with clear Propatagium (flying apparatus seen in flying animals) evolved off of the Maniraptoran branch. Besides the famous Archaeopterix, you can see examples of this in Troodontids and even some small Velociraptors. This is all over the course of 10\u2019s of millions of years. Many birds are in danger but largely birds are present on every continent because many species are far more adaptable than even most mammals. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if after the nuclear apocalypse that pigeons, for instance, outlive us.\u00a0"

                "Content": "You cannot hold the moral high ground when the Commander in Chief is routinely sundowning.  I pulled the lever for Joe, but my real vote was against trump.  I don't blame Joe for inheriting a big covid mess - courtesy of Agent Orange.  I do blame him (and Jill) for not gracefully passing the baton at the end of this term.  Calling early onset dementia *stuttering* is an insult to people who do stutter.  Joe made Kamala the \"border czar\" but he didn't articulate a firm policy for her to execute.  He put her in an impossible situation.  I am pro immigration and pro immigrant.  I am also very much opposed to open borders and the resulting chaos/strain on our system.  Over one billion people live south of us, the vast majority in poorer countries.  Some in places where the homicide rate is 10X ours.  \n\nIf you look around, you'll see a country filled with the food, clothing, architecture and religion that people bring with them.  Good stuff.  It is also true that at some point - assimilation became a dirty word.  It isn't.  English classes are optional in MSP schools and the dropout rate of Somalian males is high.  Probably a strong contributor to their 40% unemployment rate.  I like Walz - he's a good guy overall.  It's also true that at some point, you need to be honest about the way cultures are meshing or clashing.  A 40% unemployment rate also correlates to a higher crime rate.  Progressives have made conversations like this very painful because they instantly jump to the conclusion that the conversation is driven by melanin levels instead of culture/behavior.  So - yes the Republicans have become the party of fear, anger and hate.  But the Democrats have their own share of anti-reality propagandists."

The Paris Agreement targets of 1.5\u00b0C and 2.0\u00b0C were more wishful thinking and feel-good political posturing than realistically feasible. \n\nGiven our current trajectory, a more reasonable question is whether we can stay below +3\u00b0C. Four years of Trump probably sets the world back by something like a quarter of a degree. If we're lucky, Elon Musk may moderate some of Trump's worst climate plans. If we're not, we're at least unlikely to see Trump get elected to a third term."

They require massive infrastructure upgrades to accommodate new solar farms (which the installer has to pay for).\n\nLand isn't actually the issue, it's connecting to the grid.

This will help clean our water, use less salt, and generate electricity all at the same time. It's a slam dunk really. The only barrier to implement is the cost and jurisdiction. \n\nSolar panels are going to be hit with a big tariff by Trump. He has also promised to end federal subsidies and tax refunds for them, which used to refund as much as 30% of the entire project cost with no cap. Meaning if you do a standard house for about 30k, you get 10k back. If a municipality does it for 300 million, they get 100 million back. The same is true for battery storage as long as they don't do the project the same year. \n\nThis is a major tool from the Biden build back better infrastructure bill. Remember it, because Trump wants to shred it. Robbing all of us the ability to become energy independent. I say this because solar + batteries often are enough to save you as much as you'd pay in your property taxes, or more a year. \n\nBeing sustainable isn't just for the environment. It's for the people. Every discussion we have should be centered around how much it actually saves us. It's the only way to claw back the attention of a nation poisoned to its core with rugged individualism for the poor and extreme alienation."

Vacant halls, etc.\n\nUnder Reagan, we at least looked the Democrats as the \"loyal opposition\" like what happens in Europe.  They weren't demonized or treated with contempt, at least, not to the extent they are now.\n\nCourageous Republicans or Democrats for that matter could walk across the aisle, talk, discuss policy and say \"Ok....you'll come here, no further, fine, i'll come here and we can both walk away with something we both can be proud of\""

Homes on geologically unstable barrier islands like the NC outer banks?  Nope.   Cities below sea level like New Orleans?   No.    That logic doesn\u2019t apply to all of Florida, but it does apply to low lying coastal areas.   (It is all fairly low lying, but we start with the lowest ).\n\nI do not suggest withdrawing coverage suddenly, but rather giving people many years of notice and some form of assistance to move if it is their primary residence.   But we can only fight the sea for so long, the sooner we surrender the less we lose.   Florida is a unique example, dykes that protect New Orleans or the Netherlands won\u2019t work because the bedrock is porous."

How long before you start complaining that you shouldn't have to subsidize my choice to live on the flood plain?\n\nFloridians continue to build in the high-risk areas on the Gulf Coast, and DeSantis shrugs it off, saying that there will always be a demand to live in a beautiful place despite the hurricanes. \nThe population in the vulnerable areas continues to grow, people are *choosing* to move their, Florida is encouraging it, it's reckless behavior, the outcome is inevitable, and people are tired of subsidizing it.

In my old neighborhood in Texas, half the homes were in the 100 year flood plain.  Those houses have flooded 6 times since 1990.  \n\nBetter to buy out their homes at market value and zone the area as no good for housing."

                "Content": "If you ask around, you'll get a pretty common economic and fiscal rake that we are already broke as a nation. Climate change, unaddressed, will make it go broke faster than not. So climate change is the answer to your hopes and dreams. Eventually these boomers will be gone and so will the viability of tracts of Florida and other places. Then the changes come. Of course too late to do anything about climate change itself, but if you're aware of that stuff at all, you already knew that at this point. Personally, I'm hoping things get bad enough that nature itself corrects our thermodynamic mistakes. What's more effective than decarbonizing to reduce climate change effects? Climate change effects getting rid of the main sources of carbon emissions for you: people. We're already on our way, birthrate declines and peak oil, and hopefully enough tech and investment to make things more efficient. I bet we gracefully reach net zero right at the point where it's too late lol.\n\nIt's either this, or we start our own mass movements and start our own woke country somewhere. Just go take over, since that's perfectly allowed in today's world. We can be nice to the indigenous people too while we're at it. We need an America 2.0, rally all the woke and become the most powerful and forward nation in the world. That or you can take matters into your own hands and become and independent insurance adjuster and go kick people out of Florida for fun. That or, a little more grim than that, go pull a Luigi. It's us, them, or the future. Hell, I just saw earlier someone talking about how the WW2 nukes saved lives. Amazing. That's like an ethics and morality hack. These people don't care what you do to them or other people. So let's force the next stage of human evolution and cultural development. Get rid of the problems in a very straightforward and practical manner. We only need like ten thousand Luigi's, or maybe a lot fewer than that. Sitting on reddit whining about how stupid they all are isn't going to spur them towards any improvements, so why don't we just ditch these qualms about the sanctity of life? They're threatening all of us and the world. This is just a preemptive strike.\n\nAnyway, I'm mostly talking out of my ass for fun. But we need to get to a point where we are no longer relying on these people anymore; this corpse we are proverbially tethered to in this three-legged race to the future. If we don't do something about them, then all of our descendants are certainly doomed to deal with a planet that will increasingly be less hospitable for life. Taking out the CEO's can be our insurance plan. I'm kidding of course, but this is the most immediate means of action, besides perhaps making a hobby of puncturing corporate tires or something.\n\nAnyway, i'd say sit back and relax. Enjoy every year when Florida gets ground down by another record breaking storm and season. If you aren't going to take direct action and don't have plans to be richer than Elon and buy global elections, this is all we have is this nice ride on this Titanic ship until the ride is over, either for us or the ship. RIP to all the sensible and informed good people out there. Let's start our own country. We might need to crack a few eggs though. Our descendants will thank us when they aren't having to eat each other to survive, we can start today by feasting on the rich. Mwahaha.\n\nAnyway, this is just poetry folks. Don't get any ideas unless you have any to begin with."

Like yours. \n\n\nMore competition for jobs, more competition for homes, more pressure on aging infrastructure, with overflowing schools, hospitals and garbage tips and wild peak hour traffic. There are only so many \"safe\" zones, and there are a LOT of people. \n\n\nInternational climate migration will be massive within a few years, you really want to add tens of millions more humans to the migration merry go round? \n\nMight be better to make people use insurance funds received to rebuild smarter - or make insurance dependent on mitigation of likely climate change impacts. Maybe having ground level as storage only to prevent damage to belongings, or having your home heavily defensible against wildfire. Cyclone rated roofs - whatever that homes risk is, lessen it or no insurance. \n\n\nA huge part of the problem is approvals on new housing in these areas without requiring them to mitigate their unique risks-  homes that are sitting ducks are those being approved on flood plains, in regular wildfire areas, cyclone zones.\n\n\n Unless the developers can show their properties ~~have been~~  can be built to withstand the most likely disasters in that region, can demonstrate that these homes will be insurable, they shouldnt be getting approval.

Why does the existence of climate change bother some people so much? And what do they get out of denying it? Regardless of if you\u2019re \u201cskeptical of the evidence\u201d or something like that, you would think a rational person would still be open minded and interested in learning more. Some people are weirdly defensive about climate change as if someone is personally accusing them of a crime",

That's when science was cool and very few people made a career out of denying it, just a few kooks.\n\nBut now science is telling us stuff people don't wanna hear.  And at the same time the externalised costs and unintended consequences of the last century's technological enthusiasm are starting to be visible.  Microplastics.  Soil depletion, aquifer depletion, species extinction.  CO2 concentration, climate destabilisation.  Science is now bringing us bad news, warnings and predictions of trouble instead of promises of miracle toys.  And predictably, people who only liked science on a cargo-cult basis -- as a kind of Santy Claus who brought them goodies -- are now turning against it and getting heavily into cults, fundie religion, Qnacy of various flavours."

Not even close. \n\nBiden took his climate plan to COP26 where critics told us that it was not enough to keep America's climate commitments. Already not enough. \n\nHe brought that home and watered it down further because of opposition in his own ranks from people like Manchin in order to get it passed. \n\nSo yes, it passed. But it was a watered down version of a policy that was already not enough to keep us from causing massive suffering in the future. \n\nAnd during Biden's term he approved more new fossil fuel projects than Trump did. And the US currently has record levels of fossil fuel extraction. That has undermined a lot of what value there was in the IRA. \n\nSo no....I am not celebrating Biden's term as some victory for climate change action. Trump would be immensely worse, but Biden also doesn't take the issue seriously."

Federal data show less than 1 percent of plastic foam products are recycled.  \n        \n>One of the larger producers of expanded foam ware, Dart Container, said the company is \"adapting to an evolving regulatory environment\" but will not be doing as much business in California.  \n         \n>\"While the recent legislation has required us to make the difficult decision to reduce the size of our workforce and operations within the state, Dart remains dedicated to serving our customers by continually innovating and delivering sustainable, reliable, and affordable products,\" Dart Container CEO Keith Clark told Newsweek via email. \"We are actively realigning our resources to position Dart to meet the changing needs of our industry and customers.\"\n            \nGood.

According to a Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_Container), the company is the world's largest manufacturer of foam cups and containers. In 1994, Dart Container owners and brothers, Kenneth B. Dart and Robert C. Dart, renounced their U.S. citizenship and eventually moved to the Cayman Islands, according to the article. In 2002, the Dart brothers and their companies paid $26 million in back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, and in May 2013, fifty agents of the Argentine tax authority raided the local Dart Container subsidiary Dart Sudamericana SRL on alleged tax evasion charges, according to the article."

                "Content": "Let's follow some photons from the edge of the atmosphere to the surface of the earth and back again.  As the stream of photons fly through the atmosphere,  some are absorbed, some scattered, some reflected back to space. At the layer where clouds form, the absence of clouds means more photons shoot straight through to the ground.  On a bright sunny day, the amount of energy reaching ground is like one hair dryer per square meter of land.  The land heats up. That night (anytime really) the ground gives off infrared photons as it sheds heat.  Some photons shoot upward, some of those are absorbed by the atmosphere, some by clouds,  and some shoot out into space.   \n\nIn order for the planet to not heat up, the amount of energy in those photons coming down cannot exceed the energy in the photons leaving the earth for space.  The earth currently has an imbalance,  something close to 1 watt per square meter isn't making it back to space. It is only one thousandth of the hair dryer worth of energy raining down on every square meter, but it builds up over time.  \n\nWhen visible light coming down to earth is reflected by a cloud, the cloud is a sunscreen, and we feel the shade of a cloud because we don't feel the energy of the sun heating us.  At night (anytime really but it is easier to think about night) when the infrared photons shoot up from every warm surface, the infrared that is absorbed and reemitted by clouds keeps our weather warmer. Living in a cold winter climate, my neighbors all know that on a clear night, the temperature will drop much more than a night with clouds. So, here clouds work as a blanket."

By all rights we should not be experiencing botflies in December! My young dog had a lump on her back looked like it was a cyst or abscess. So i made an appointment to take her in on monday. Tonight it ruptured , as i cut the hair away to clean it there it was a volcano with a hole in the center. Inside moving around was a botfly larva. I can not get it out without risking killing it and sending her into anaphylactic shock, so on monday the vet will have to. Seeing these parasites in winter is an alarm bell. We are too warm too long and that dont bode well for us or our furry friends.",

In a society with homes built like ours, chagas development is vanishingly rare.\n\nI live in the US in a state that has always had plenty kissing bugs, in an area that I can find them for you in just about anyone\u2019s backyard.  In surveys, a sizable fraction of them are carriers.  But no one really gets bitten by them like they do in places with poorly sealed dwellings, and particularly where thatched roofs prevail.  It\u2019s just not a high risk with our current way of life in the US.\n\nEdited to add: not minimizing that chagas is serious if contacted, or saying that you are wrong they\u2019ll move north.  Just giving some practical perspective on this vs risks of mosquito or tick borne diseases, for instance, which do get transmitted at levels to be worried about.  Chagas is widespread in parts of Central America with different ways of life, but rare in the US even inside its equally naturally prevalent range."

It is unfortunate humans especially us in America have to get punched in the face repeatedly until we realize getting punched in the face isn\u2019t a good thing and we should act on it. I believe we can make it to the other side but I guess a lot of us were hoping we could get ahead of this one, but unfortunately here we are and foreseeably more suffering to come until systemic change to our energy production comes to fruition. \n\nJust like covid won\u2019t be the last pandemic nor the worst the same goes for this storm."

                "Content": "Atmospheric rivers are relatively narrow but long bands of moisture that drop a large amount of rain. They usually start near the equator and then move towards the poles.    The\u00a0average\u00a0atmospheric river carries an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River. They used to be known as a Pineapple Express (warm wet bands of clouds that dumped rain on us (but brought slightly warmer temperatures).\n\nFor where I grew up on the west side of Vancouver Island, it meant days of rain (300mm+ a day). The wettest day we had was just over 400mm in 24 hours, and over 900mm in three days. \n\nAbout half of the rainfall on the coast of BC (and the west coast of North America) comes from less than half a dozen atmospheric rivers through the winter. Atmospheric rivers transport more freshwater than most rivers on Earth do. Just think of a river in the sky that falls until it has no more water rather than a storm that brings rain for a bit.\n\n\nLinks you might like (the Canadian ones have video of the damage one caused a few years ago):\n\nhttps://ubyssey.ca/science/when-it-rains-it-pours-atmospheric-rivers-explained/\n\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/stories/what-are-atmospheric-rivers\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/9234031/bc-weather-what-is-atmospheric-river/amp/\n\nhttps://scijinks.gov/atmospheric-river/"

Used to be open 6-8 weeks pretty consistently from the 70s until around the year 2000, but it's freezing later and later as time goes on ([see graph on this page](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/history-rideau-canal-skateway)) despite advances in techniques for caring for the ice."

                "Content": "They provide actions in the Conclusions:\n\n\"**Energy**\n\nThe world must quickly implement massive energy efficiency and conservation practices and must replace fossil fuels with low-carbon renewables \\[figure 2h\\] and other cleaner sources of energy if safe for people and the environment \\[figure S3\\]. We should leave remaining stocks of fossil fuels in the ground (see the timelines in IPCC 2018) and should carefully pursue effective negative emissions using technology such as carbon extraction from the source and capture from the air and especially by enhancing natural systems (see \u201cNature\u201d \\[step\\]). Wealthier countries need to support poorer nations in transitioning away from fossil fuels. We must swiftly eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels \\[figure 2o\\] and use effective and fair policies for steadily escalating carbon prices to restrain their use.\n\n**Short-lived pollutants**\n\nWe need to promptly reduce the emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, including methane \\[figure 3b\\], black carbon (soot), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Doing this could slow climate feedback loops and potentially reduce the short-term warming trend by more than 50% over the next few decades while saving millions of lives and increasing crop yields due to reduced air pollution (Shindell et al. 2017). The 2016 Kigali amendment to phase down HFCs is welcomed.\n\n**Nature**\n\nWe must protect and restore Earth's ecosystems. Phytoplankton, coral reefs, forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands, peatlands, soils, mangroves, and sea grasses contribute greatly to sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Marine and terrestrial plants, animals, and microorganisms play significant roles in carbon and nutrient cycling and storage. We need to quickly curtail habitat and biodiversity loss \\[figure 2f\u20132g\\], protecting the remaining primary and intact forests, especially those with high carbon stores and other forests with the capacity to rapidly sequester carbon (proforestation), while increasing reforestation and afforestation where appropriate at enormous scales. Although available land may be limiting in places, up to a third of emissions reductions needed by 2030 for the Paris agreement (less than 2\u00b0C) could be obtained with these natural climate solutions (Griscom et al. 2017).\n\n**Food**\n\nEating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products \\[figure 2c\u2013d\\], especially ruminant livestock (Ripple et al. 2014), can improve human health and significantly lower GHG emissions (including methane in the \u201cShort-lived pollutants\u201d step). Moreover, this will free up croplands for growing much-needed human plant food instead of livestock feed, while releasing some grazing land to support natural climate solutions (see \u201cNature\u201d \\[step\\]). Cropping practices such as minimum tillage that increase soil carbon are vitally important. We need to drastically reduce the enormous amount of food waste around the world.\n\n**Economy**\n\nExcessive extraction of materials and overexploitation of ecosystems, driven by economic growth, must be quickly curtailed to maintain long-term sustainability of the biosphere. We need a carbon-free economy that explicitly addresses human dependence on the biosphere and policies that guide economic decisions accordingly. Our goals need to shift from GDP growth and the pursuit of affluence toward sustaining ecosystems and improving human well-being by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality.\n\n**Population**\n\nStill increasing by roughly 80 million people per year, or more than 200,000 per day \\[figure 2a\u2013b\\], the world population must be stabilized\u2014and, ideally, gradually reduced\u2014within a framework that ensures social integrity. There are proven and effective policies that strengthen human rights while lowering fertility rates and lessening the impacts of population growth on GHG emissions and biodiversity loss. These policies make family-planning services available to all people, remove barriers to their access and achieve full gender equity, including primary and secondary education as a global norm for all, especially girls and young women (Bongaarts and O\u2019Neill 2018).\""

We went without. When a societies resources are bent to achieve a particular goal then those resources aren\u2019t available elsewhere. But nobody wants to go without a car, a big screen TV, all the plastic trinkets that permeate our modern life. In fact, if we weren\u2019t all such mindless consumers (I\u2019m guilty of this too) it\u2019s unlikely we would need to generate nearly as much power as we do today.\n\nThis set me off on a deep dive reading about austerity measures, Victory gardens, the home front etc. \n\nA lot of those measure are what we'd now call the circular economy \u2013 and if we could all adopt that mindset consumption would drop immediately. There are lots of groups around the place practicing these ideas. The more I have done it, the more I have realised this is just how my grandparents probably lived. (And how my hippy friends have always done things.)\n\nGetting people on board doesn't have to be about collapse. It can just be about developing a better system than the frankly insane take-make-waste model. But I acknowledge that all this is easier for me now (middle-aged, live in the country,  partner is onboard, etc) than it would have been when I was younger and lived in the city and wanted to be in-the-world."

I brought up Climate Change being the cause and she shut me down right away. She said there was no such thing as Climate Change and this was \"Perfectly normal weather\" and things like this just happen sometimes. My Grandfather and Great Aunt who chimed into the conversation to conquer with her answer. I was in complete SHOCK! \n\nHow can they deny Climate Change while a Wildfire blazes right by their house? How can they even call this Weather normal? I went Trick or Treating with my cousins a week ago and felt so hot in my costume.

                "Content": "Yesterday, America had one of its worst days of bird flu to date. For starters, the CDC confirmed the country\u2019s first severe case of human bird-flu infection.\n\nThe patient, a Louisiana resident who is over the age of 65 and has underlying medical conditions, is in the hospital with severe respiratory illness and is in critical condition. This is the first time transmission has been traced back to exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency after weeks of rising infections among dairy herds & people. In LA, public-health officials confirmed two cats died after consuming raw milk that had been recalled due to a risk of bird-flu contamination.\n\nSince March, the virus has spread among livestock & to the humans who handle them. The CDC maintains that the public-health risk is low because no evidence has shown that the virus can spread among people, and illness in humans has mostly been mild. But severe illness has always been a possibility.\n\nThat an infected teenager in British Columbia was hospitalized with respiratory distress last month only emphasized not every human case would be mild. Now here we are, with a severe case in the U.S. Although worrying, the new case doesn\u2019t change much about predicted trajectory of bird flu.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article thread \u2b07\ufe0f 6 min\n\n[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldpr6nqkns2m](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldpr6nqkns2m)"

Ah fuck it\u2019s 50% I thought it was lower. \n\nIf this starts spreading among humans, the right is going to literally kill themselves off and take many normal humans with them.

Each of us should also advocate for others to join the boycott.\n\nSwitching to a plant-based food production system would be the most effective way to quickly impact climate change since animal agriculture is such a potent source of greenhouse gases.

Many of the worst parts of climate change (mass droughts and water shortages, mass crop failures, mass starvations, unsurvivable heat waves, mass extinctions of the majority of species, mass human deaths, mass migration, more frequent and severe natural disasters, and climate wars) are probably unavoidable.  We are likely past many key irreversible tipping points.\n\nBut if we don't change our habits soon, we might pass even worse tipping points resulting in a world where humans cannot live."

Because we're already a year into that swing prediction, and we're higher this year, so if we're going to call it as being under 1.5, we'll need both of the next two years to be lower, right? If that happens I'll... what, apologize for putting numbers up and saying that I think we've blown 1.5? (Edit: actually, Reddit archives threads after a while, so I might not be able to actually apologize for putting up those numbers. So I guess, apologies in advance if you're right and we get nice, \"cool\" 1.1C over preindustrial weather for the next two years.

A meteorologist teared up because it\u2019s such a horrifically strong hurricane. At what point will Florida just be too dangerous to live in? The state isn\u2019t landlocked, it\u2019s extremely vulnerable to tropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis(if they happen to get a tsunami). At this point, every few months a hurricane that requires evacuation hits Florida and I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s worth living there now that weather seems to be getting worse. I get it, Florida has survived many many hurricanes probably since the North American continent formed, but it\u2019s still concerning considering that climate change is getting worse every year and Florida might be completely underwater soon. It\u2019s scary to think about, isn\u2019t it? I just know that I\u2019d already be moving out of there if I lived there. \n\n[I\u2019ve turned off my notifications for this post]",

The implications are significant: if early industrial warming has been underestimated, climate policies may need to become more aggressive to meet global targets. It\u2019s a stark reminder of the need for accelerated decarbonization and global cooperation, not only to meet climate goals but to prevent more severe impacts that come with each fraction of a degree in rising temperatures.\n\nThe study highlights the urgent need for rapid decarbonization to avoid the most dangerous climate change impacts.",

                "Content": "Permafrost, found beneath 15% of the northern hemisphere (14.4 million km\u00b2 or 563 gigatons of carbon), is composed of frozen organic material that, in many areas dipping below -5\u00b0C, has stored carbon for millennia.\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, permafrost covered vast areas. Today\u2019s warming, especially in polar regions, threatens stability. The Arctic is warming 4x faster than global average since 1979, raising concerns about thawing permafrost releasing carbon dioxide & methane, & worsening global warming.\n\nA recent SSP study considered two Northern Hemisphere scenarios:  \n  \n\u2022 SSP126, optimistically limiting global warming to 2.0\u00b0C, would thaw 119 Gt of carbon by 2100.\n\n\u2022 SSP585, a pessimistic scenario assuming continued fossil fuel reliance, would see 252 Gt of carbon thawed by 2100.\n\n4% to 8% of this thawed carbon will release into the atmosphere by 2100, translating to a maximum of 10 Gt under SSP126 & 20 Gt under SSP585. For context, human activities in 2023 emitted 11.3 Gt of carbon. While significant, projected thawing emissions remain smaller than annual human emissions.\n\nThawing contributes carbon cycles in multiple ways. Decomposing organic matter releases nitrogen, which plants can absorb, stimulating growth. Nitrogen availability could increase vegetation nitrogen stocks by 10 to 26 million tons & carbon stocks in plants by 0.4 to 1.6 Gt under the two scenarios.\n\nHowever, increased plant growth does not fully offset carbon losses from thawed permafrost. Thawing alters plant species composition & ecosystem dynamics, with broader carbon & nitrogen cycles implications such as abrupt thaw events, root deepening, & microbial activity \u2013 accelerating carbon release.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldean2g2av2j](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldean2g2av2j)"

I always wondered what effect this would have & whether it was being studied.\n\nWent down this rabbit hole a bit last year and found a few disturbing things - notably that there is little scientific info or research being done on the depths of permafrost.\n\nWhat I found (and someone please add to or correct me) was the last investigation of permafrost depth was done in 1949 by the Soviets (so obviously didn't include North America's arctic territory. \n\nSeems to me if arctic warming continues at it's current pace AND there is a (potentially) much bigger reservoir of stored CO2 & methane it would set up or accelerate a feedback loop?\n\nAny thoughts or opinions?"

                "Content": ">The study, published Friday night, identified a total of 35 buildings that have sunk by as much as three inches between 2016 and 2023, including the iconic Surf Club Towers and Faena Hotel, the Porsche Design Tower, The Ritz-Carlton Residences, Trump Tower III and Trump International Beach Resorts. Together, the high rises accommodate tens of thousands of residents and tourists. Some have more than 300 units, including penthouses that cost millions of dollars.  \n        \n>Preliminary data also shows signs that some buildings along the coasts of Broward and Palm Beach are sinking, too.  \n            \n>Initially, researchers looked at satellite images that can measure fractions of an inch of subsidence to determine whether the phenomenon had occurred leading up to the collapse of Champlain Towers in Surfside, the 2021 catastrophe that killed 98 people and led to laws calling for structural reviews of older condos across the state. The researchers did not see any signs of settlement before the collapse \u201cindicating that settlement was not the cause of collapse,\u201d according to a statement.   \n       \n>In total, they found subsidence ranging between roughly 0.8 and just over 3 inches, mostly in Sunny Isles Beach, Surfside, and at two buildings in Miami Beach \u2013 the Faena Hotel and L\u2019atelier condo \u2013 and one in Bal Harbour.    \n        \n>The possible climate connection  \n            \n>Experts also pointed to the impact the emission of fossil fuels and the resulting warming of the climate is having on the overall stability of Miami-Dade\u2019s barrier islands.  \n       \n>For one, rising sea levels are now encroaching on sand and limestone underneath our feet. That could lead to the corrosion of the pillars on which high-rises stand \u2013 a serious issue, GangaRao said, though if that\u2019s the case \u201cthere may be a way to salvage these buildings,\u201d by fixing the foundation."

        "Content": "As the new U.S. administration plans to ramp up fossil fuel production and diminish efforts to transition to alternative, renewable energy sources, global warming in the industrial age already has reached the milestone promoted as the possible point of no return.  Frighteningly, 2024 global temperatures will actually surpass \"remarkable annual temperatures\" set in 2023.\n\n>*Editor*\u2019*s Note (12/9/24): This story is being republished after the* [*Copernicus Climate Change Service released global temperature data from November*](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-november-2024)*. The data confirmed that it is \u201ceffectively certain\u201d that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and will surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures....*\n\n>It is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d that 2024 will be the first year to be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than in the preindustrial era, before heat-trapping fossil fuels began accumulating in the atmosphere, the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) announced today.\n\n>*These dubious distinctions mean* [*2024 will surpass the remarkable record annual temperatures*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-2024s-record-hottest-year-u-s-voters-will-decide-climates-path-forward/) *set just last year, one of the clearest markers of the* ***unfolding planetary climate catastrophe.***  (Italic and BF emphasis added in this paragraph.)\n\n[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2024-will-be-the-first-year-to-exceed-the-1-5-degree-celsius-warming/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2024-will-be-the-first-year-to-exceed-the-1-5-degree-celsius-warming/)\n\n>According to its ERA5 dataset \\[see reply for an explanation\\], the agency said it was \"virtually certain\" that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, and it will likely be more than 1.55 C above.\n\n>For decades, [scientists have warned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-un-report-disaster-emissions-future/) that average global temperatures should not get any higher than 1.5 C above pre-industrial times in order to prevent deadly weather conditions that could impact people worldwide.\u00a0\n\n>The world has already warmed considerably and has seen the effects with back-to-back heat waves, droughts and\u00a0[unprecedented flooding and hurricane events](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-milton-florida-landfall-records/). The way farmers are able to grow food has already started to shift, and with\u00a0[1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-heat-global-warming-economy/), agricultural yields will decline and sea levels could rise up to 10 feet, researchers have found. Experts say the oceans will also be warmer, fueling more powerful hurricanes and threatening ecosystems that are fundamental for economies and help protect areas from inclement weather.\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-european-scientists-say-2024-virtually-certain-to-be-warmest-year-on-record/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-european-scientists-say-2024-virtually-certain-to-be-warmest-year-on-record/)\n\n>**Why 1.5 C?**\n\n>In 2015, in response to the growing urgency of climate impacts, nearly every country in the world signed onto the Paris Agreement, a landmark international treaty under which 195 nations pledged to hold the Earth\u2019s temperature to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,\u201d and going further, aim to \u201climit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels....\u201d\n\n>The treaty was informed by a fact-finding report which concluded that, even global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average, over an extended, decades-long period, would lead to high risks for \u201csome regions and vulnerable ecosystems.\u201d The recommendation then, was to set the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit as a \u201cdefense line\u201d \u2014 if the world can keep below this line, it potentially could avoid the more extreme and irreversible climate effects that would occur with a 2 degrees Celsius increase, and for some places, an even smaller increase than that.\n\n[https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-climate-benchmark-rising-temperatures-0827](https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-climate-benchmark-rising-temperatures-0827)\n\nEDIT:  Infamous\\_Employer\\_85 has posted several excellent links in this thread relevant to the causes and consequences of global warming.  I suspect all of the links sourced at federal government websites will be deleted once the Trump administration takes control of NOAA.  The Wikipedia link about tipping points obviously is especially relevant.  Thanks Infamous\\_Employer!  BTW, if you use Wikipedia, donate a few dollars to support it!\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping\\_points\\_in\\_the\\_climate\\_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system)\n\nExplore the NOAA links while you still can.  Hopefully, I'm wrong that NOAA research will be publicly suppressed by the Trump administration, but I remember similar censorship in Trump's last administration, and he appears much more committed to his Big Lie climate change denial propaganda this time around.\n\n[https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/tavg/ocean/12/10/1850-2024?trend=true&trend\\_base=100&begtrendyear=1994&endtrendyear=2024](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/tavg/ocean/12/10/1850-2024?trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=1994&endtrendyear=2024)\n\n[https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous\\_Employer\\_85/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous_Employer_85/)\n\nEDIT2:  Slowing or collapse of the AMOC should be a major concern about global warming.

The two figures are slightly different things. 2024's record breaking heat is partly driven by cyclical El Nino conditions (the reason it's higher than other iterations of that cycle is, of course, climate change).\n\nThe Paris target is about the underlying warming we've added, which would only show up over a ten year period and is unlikely to have been met yet.\n\nIt's still a depressing milestone, and further proof that we're way off track to meet Paris. But I think it's important to be accurate, or it plays into the hands of people wanting to create confusion (\"you said 1.5 would be the end of the world\", \"I thought you said we'd already passed that target\", etc)"

Especially lumber that we use for things like paper products.  \nYou would think that growing bamboo for industrial uses would be extremely cheap and easy to do. The stuff grows like weeds. Takes only 5-10 years for bamboo to fully mature.  \nSome types of bamboo grows several inches per day.\n\nGuadua Bamboo is the strongest type of bamboo on the planet. And it grows in about 5-8 years.  \nCompared to most softwood trees, which take 20-40\\~ years to grow to harvestable sizes.  \nGuadua Bamboo has higher tensile strength than industrial steel, which is several times stronger than most conventional woods.  \nBamboo also sequesters massive amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, which would be an incredible help in managing carbon emissions and climate change.\n\nIt's more renewable. It grows faster. It grows in more dense clumps (more lumber per sq meter). Its just as strong as many types of lumber. It takes less effort to harvest.\n\nI get that we can't just grow bamboo anywhere. But i am guessing it probably wouldn't be difficult to grow it in rainforests. So i really can't understand why they couldn't be bothered to replace what they are cutting down in the Amazon with at least bamboo, to secure their business financial future, if nothing else."

We could survive here probably through this century. So my local solution is to try to get people to see themselves as part of a local community, and pull together for the common good. I don't think that will work, but it seems like a way that could prolong some sort of existence. And I know that in the end, either we will be overrun by climate refugees or the climate wars, pandemics, etc., will eventually get us.

They are *not* talking about fixing the climate in order to stabilize WAIS they are talking about stabilizing it with an engineered solution.  \n\nI believe the entire conversation is being presented wrong.  \u201cAsk not how we can save Antarctica ask how Antarctica can supply us with energy resources\u201d.   We have a hot water upwelling and intense katabatic winds blowing off the continent.  When you have a heat source and a cold sink then you have what is needed for a Carnot cycle.  With the wind at -75 and the ocean at -2 C the power available for work is going to be less than 25 % of the energy transferred.  But no one needs to care about efficiency.  \n\nThis lament of \u201cwe cannot put a dent in global warming\u201d is totally the wrong way to look at it.  If we really have a quantity of heat that is too immense then we have a truly great power supply.  Think of the wall of data centers connected to Argentina\u2019s fiberoptic lines and using the satellites where there is no human population."

Here's the first part of the series.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1hbnfmz/atlantic\\_circulation\\_collapse\\_new\\_clues\\_on\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1hbnfmz/atlantic_circulation_collapse_new_clues_on_the/)\n\nFrom the second article:\n\n>Several high-profile research papers have brought renewed attention to the potential collapse of a crucial system of ocean currents known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, as we discussed in [part one](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/12/atlantic-circulation-collapse-new-clues-on-the-fate-of-a-crucial-conveyor-belt/) of this two-part post. Huge uncertainties in both the timing and details of potential impacts of such a collapse remain. Even so, scientists warned in a recent open letter (see below) that \u201csuch an ocean circulation change would have devastating and irreversible impacts....\u201d\n\n>New research is leading to startlingly specific time frames for when the AMOC might collapse. These studies aren\u2019t without controversy, as we\u2019ll see below. But collectively, they\u2019ve raised the profile of AMOC \u2013\u00a0and also raised fears that the initial impacts of AMOC collapse could manifest within the lifetimes of many of us.\n\n>Stefan Rahmstorf at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is an eminent researcher who\u2019s studied AMOC and its various modes for more than 30 years. In October 2024, discussing the specter of AMOC collapse, Rahmstorf [warned](https://x.com/rahmstorf/status/1851234910914113718):\n\n>Even with a medium likelihood of occurrence, given that the outcome would be catastrophic and impacting the entire world for centuries to come, we believe more needs to be done to minimize this risk.\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/12/how-much-should-you-worry-about-a-collapse-of-the-atlantic-conveyor-belt/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/12/how-much-should-you-worry-about-a-collapse-of-the-atlantic-conveyor-belt/)\n\nMuch of the research discussed in the second article contains frightening warnings.  Here's an example:\n\n>[**Meridional Overturning Circulation**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01097-4.epdf?sharing_token=y8JBog7_gEk_5HFlI0Q4r9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0ODQw4Na6S4LwvIIwjZ_S3NdBoG6pi8c5NBfIwoUKp1VC9W7eJZj-EyIQKwXZfIwtnDWPBwJY6rVzhCSmuUsGMRLtI4FgsW78uj5CZkHS-MOarkiFZSm1lWEWyNHX_qaD9Q1EAljMmEng0pLXT8MqHlUXkS6RCam0Ih67KxucxzYA67gpbHGhmJYYroeErjzoM%3D&tracking_referrer=www.wired.com) (Boers, Nature Climate Change 2021). Led by the Potsdam Institute\u2019s Niklas Boers, this study used eight independent indices gleaned from Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature and salinity data. One goal was to piece together a broader picture of AMOC behavior since the late 1800s, given that organized observations of AMOC\u2019s three-dimensional flow began only in the 2000s.\n\n>The overall conclusion of Boers and coauthors: \u201cAMOC could be close to a critical transition to its weak circulation mode.\u201d\n\nAs with all negative climate change impacts, to reduce the risks of climate change disasters, mankind first of all must slash fossil fuel consumption ASAP.",

Among them, China initiated the world\u2019s largest afforestation program, Three-North Afforestation Program (TNAP, 1978\u20132050), in which the afforestation in sandy land has been questioned during the first 40 years. In fact, the contribution of the TNAP to vegetation establishment and its effectiveness in desertification control still remain unclear, which limited the further construction of the program.  \n       \n>...The sandy land and deserts are mainly located in the northern provincial administrative units, including Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, Henan, Jilin, and Liaoning.     \n    \n>[Map of China, Study Area, Zone of TNAP, Boundary of Provinces]  \n     \n>**Conclusions**  \n       \n>This study revealed the vegetation dynamics and desertification process in the past 40 years in the sandy land with the construction of the TNAP. Our data showed that vegetation coverage increased by only 0.5%, with increasing 113.8% and 338.8% of forest and shrubland, but decreasing 9.0% of grassland during 1978\u20132017. Desertification had little change in area, but the proportion of slight-moderate intensity increased and outweighed that of the severe-extremely severe intensity. The TNAP contributed to desertification process by 10.3% in the 40 years, which is lower than expected.    \n         \n[Map](https://www.nationsonline.org/maps/china_provinces_map1200.jpg) of China, including the 13 administrative units in the TNAP \u2014 Clicking the map enlarges it \u2014 [Nations Online](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/china_administrative_map.htm).     \n    \nTragically, for the estimated 8.1 billion ([8,056,083,537](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/dashboard?COUNTRY_YEAR=2024&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2024&dashboard_page=country)) individuals alive in the world today ([July 1, 2024](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/international-programs/about/idb.html)), and any of them and  others alive in the future, any atmospheric carbon that might be sequestered by this afforestation project in China will have relatively small effect against the annual emissions of 11.90 billion tonnes (11.90 Gt) of CO2 emissions released from fossil fuels and industry in China in 2023 (interactive [chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?country=OWID_WRL~CHN)), annual emissions of 12.0 billion tonnes (12.0 Gt) of fossil CO2 that are projected to be released from coal, oil, and gas in China in 2024 (PDF, [p. 6](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2024-519/essd-2024-519.pdf#page=6), line 197, [GCB 2024](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2024-519/) preprint), or the cumulative total of 272.53 billion tonnes (272.53 Gt) of CO2 emissions released from fossil fuels and industry in China in the period from 1907 through 2023 ([chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co-emissions?country=OWID_WRL~CHN))."

This might mean replacing gas powered heating with electric heat pumps. It might mean organizing to get small scale solar installations in the parking lots or rooftops of your local school, church, library, museum, or another institution. Solar is often now cheaper than alternative energy sources, so this isn't just a \"do the right thing\" argument, it is market-based. If you live in a blue city or state, work with your local leaders and reps to put further incentives into place for renewables development. Many of these incentives are already at the state level, even under Biden. Identify climate vulnerabilities in your area, like low-lying neighborhoods near rivers that are prone to flooding, and make sure everyone you know is aware that of what risks you face and how your community could be better prepared. Have honest, compassionate conversations with those around you, build networks of trust, and know who you can count on in an emergency. These relationships must be long-term and dependable, and they help for more than just climate action. Crucially, you can do all of these things regardless of who sits in the White House."

Carbon dioxide has increased by over 10% in just two decades, largely due to human activities, wildfires, and decreased carbon absorption by forests and oceans. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo warned that these rising levels threaten the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5-2\u00b0C. The WMO\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, published ahead of COP29, cautioned that climate feedback loops, such as decreased CO2 absorption and increased emissions from wildfires, could further intensify global warming, stressing the urgent need for climate action."

Hydrogen could also be used as a reducing agent for producing metallic iron instead of carbon and give off water vapor instead of CO2 as a byproduct.  \n\nIt could even be used to produce hydrocarbon fuels from the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in air and water for transportation and portable generators.

                "Content": "This study hasn\u2019t even been peer-reviewed.  I\u2019d wait on it to be peer-reviewed and replicated/iterated upon prior to taking this so seriously.\n\nI want to see some data on the breadth and intensity of forest fires.  Small, ground level forest fires are part of forest lifecycles; these are the kind where conditions (like humidity and how dry the living trees are) mean that dead brush on the forest floor burns away, but the overwhelming majority of trees survive with little damage.\n\nMany of the forest fires we\u2019re seeing in this century are something else.  Climate has changed, making dry seasons dryer, and windier (more O2 to feed the inferno).  And we have huge spans of dead and dying (dry!) trees, that have no resistance against any kind of fire.  The huge spans of dead and dying trees within today\u2019s forests are because of climate change, including global warming AND invasive species.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe peer-reviewed, widely reproduced scientific literature that I\u2019ve read says that for trees that are still located in appropriate climates, that they\u2019re growing faster due to CO2 fertilization.  They\u2019re growing faster, but are less dense.  Like hardwood trees grown post-2000 are less hard (less density of mass) than old-growth hardwood trees.  This causes problems of its own, as the lack of density makes it more likely for the tree to split under its own weight.  But trees in areas where conditions are otherwise hospitable should be absorbing MORE CO2.\n\nThis increased growth isn\u2019t enough to offset the massive forest fires and ludicrous CO2 emissions that follows forests dying from global warming and invasive species.\n\nIt\u2019s a very interesting dilemma.  The USDA growing zones map has had every zone shift northwards, significantly, over the decades\u2026 meaning large spans of forest have species of trees that aren\u2019t in \u201cappropriate\u201d climate for their long term health.\n\nThe paradoxical solution, from my perspective, is to cut down massive spans of trees that are dead/dying or are going to die soon enough, due to the shifting climate.  This is way, way better than waiting for forest fires that convert all that timber into CO2."

Carbon sink failure doesn't cause emissions to go up, it causes measured CO2 to go up. The accepted accounting is saying that emissions are relatively flat or going down, but measured CO2 is going up drastically. This could be because sinks are failing or it also could be that the accounting of emissions is bad."

We could maybe get it to very high levels seen on earth before, I mean CO2 concentrations have been a hundred times worse, but we humans would all be dead or depopulated to the point of insignificance way before then. On a geological timescale, a complete anthropogenic runaway would be like the earth burped and rubber banded for a could hundred years, not a venus situation. We simply don't have the energy or materials to cause that. Our problem isn't 400 degree air temperatures, it's that the crops we have today don't grow and sweating doesn't work outside a tiny narrow band of a few degrees."

U might be best to reduce the risk of fire n undertake regevetation activities elsewhere first.\n\nRevegetation as a whole is very costly. Plus there r yrs where the success rates are low, especially for tubestock. Direct seeding can be a cheaper option. But this can take plants yrs to emerge, is a waste for plants with limited seed, or areas with the wrong soil. Horses for courses. Even if the plants take n grow at lightening speed it often takes decades for the trees to generate hollows and reach maturity. I am thinking end goal of habitat for wildlife, not just carbon sequestration. \n\nI tend to plant trees/shrubs that have ranges extending into drier areas that r still indiginous to the area."

We are indoctrinated to blame the politicians for their policy errors, but that\u2019s like blaming the puppet for the terrible show. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what the voters want, the parties will find wedge issues (abortion, trans-rights) to win votes then do what benefits the puppeteers (eg, more H1B instead of increased educational opportunities and support for Americans, eliminating EPA and CFPB).\n\nLuigi took the fight closer to the puppeteers (we can understand why he went there without approving of *how* he went there).  Now the puppeteers feel a sense of true danger because the target is now on their backs.  Musk, Ramaswamy, the Kochs, the Waltons, etc\u2026 the people paying for policies that endanger our society and planet \u2026 these people need to be the targets of a new movement to regain control of our government for our own interests.  \n\nBut they\u2019ve already captured the apparatuses of power, so how do we take it back from within the system that they control?  Musk has already threatened to buy new representatives if the ones in place don\u2019t do what he wants.  The Murdocks are there to convince us it\u2019s all in our best interest because it will own the libs.  There is space for a third party in our system, but it must immediately capitalize on the anger that the lower and middle class have against the puppeteer class and capture a common 70% interest.  It can\u2019t be a single issue thing, and Luigi may have tipped us to at least one of those issues.   And Musk has conveniently made himself the campaign attack ad (ie, take your country back from the rich assholes). \n\nSorry for the rant."

That\u2019s their livelihoods. \n\nSome of the ways we\u2019re currently working on it in the US (shoutout to my boys at NRCS): No till, cover crops, drastically reduced pesticides thanks to anti-pest crops, adding biochar to soil to increase soil health and carbon capture, precision ag, crop rotation, agrivoltaics, and more. Check out USDA\u2019s Natural Resource Conservation Agency. They do tons of work and outreach on this subject. At least as long as they\u2019re funded."

And I fear there are few solutions that maintain animal wellness while they're alive. There's a patent out there for a super cool closed loop corn and dairy farm. It also produces ethanol and beef. All the cows live in a stadium type building where the methane is sequestered by the ventilation system. That gas is then used as fuel to power the farm. The cow poop is used to fertilize the corn and to power the ethanol plant when necessary. The corn is used to make ethanol and the remains after ethanol extraction turned into meal for the cows. You're still burning methane and releasing carbon from cow poop, but the pollution level is minimal compared to doing it the way we do it now. Just letting useful gasses and energy to be left unconverted and to pollute the atmosphere. It's like using a coal power plant to power an electric car. Or shipping solar panels across the ocean in an oil burning ship. Like, we're working backwards here guys."

                "Content": "The sleeper issue re global warming, is how it\u2019s going to really screw up farming, and in particular farmers that are financially tied to their land.\n\n(I promise this ties back into the subject of coral reefs and fisheries.)\n\nIt\u2019s pretty damn ironic that rural areas, dependent on local agriculture to bring money into their local economy tend to be hotspots for global warming denial.\n\nFor a local economy (like a rural town) to thrive, they need more money entering rather than leaving their local economy.  In this example, money leaves a rural town as they import machinery, supplies, and all the various consumer goods.  Money enters the rural town as they \u201cexport\u201d agricultural surpluses from the town.  If their \u201cexports\u201d (not necessarily leaving the country, just their town) dwindle, more and more wealth in the form of money will leave their town, until there\u2019s not enough money in their local area for locals to trade amongst themselves.\n\nSimulations of this stuff are interesting.\n\nFor a real life example of this that is familiar, you can look at coastal fishing towns that became very poor as their fisheries dwindled.  Coastal fishing towns with plentiful fisheries grew and became wealthy, as they exported seafood from their town, money entered the town from their local exports, that money traded around the town, and everyone was better and better off.  But as the fisheries were depleted by overfishing (fish populations depleting faster than they can reproduce, and/or climate issues) the local exports dried up, less money enters the town\u2026 but everyone keeps importing stuff into the town (money leaving).  This is why fisheries that dwindled and basically collapsed led to local towns\u2026 **everyone in that town**\u2026 becoming much more poor\u2026 even if they weren\u2019t fishers themselves.\n\nAs agriculture starts to suffer, the same sad effect will happen to rural towns across the USA, that are dependent on the local export of farm commodities.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s so paradoxical to me\u2026 that rural areas have the highest rates of \u201cglobal warming denial\u201d.  It\u2019s the rural agricultural areas that are going to get hit the hardest, economically.  It won\u2019t be Silicon Valley or \u201ceastern elites\u201d that takes the big hit to their economies.  I mean people all over will be paying more for groceries, but that\u2019s small potatoes compared to your local economy taking a massive dump."

What I've seen in the past is that data on coral loss is questionable since reported by many small nations who don't actually do surveys, other than \"ask a few fisherman\" then send a report to be compiled by an international agency.\n\nIf true, it might have been due to the warmer ocean temperature from Mar 2023-Jan 2024 (up to +0.9 C anomaly), which are now falling back to normal (+0.66 C):\n\n[https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst\\_daily/?dm\\_id=world2](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/?dm_id=world2)\n\nBut a +0.9 C rise would be an iffy explanation for coral bleaching since coral is thriving in the Red Sea, which has the highest temperatures, well above most of Indonesian waters.  BTW, bleaching doesn't mean the coral has died.  It is a regular occurence when the polyps eliminate the symbiotic algae, often due to threats from pathogens or starfish."

                "Content": "If I understand, the 12% more intense is the additional energy theoretically available in a 1.3\u00b0C hotter climate system.  That additional energy also makes severe events twice as likely to occur.  \n\nThe atmosphere can hold more water as it warms. The extreme weather events will get stronger and more frequent.  I personally think the doubling is a low estimate.  There's been an insane amount of flooding these last 2 years. \n\n\nFrom the original source:\n\n>At the time of writing, the day after the event, only one out of three observation-based datasets that were considered was up-to-date to include the event. Consequently, we can not reliably estimate how rare the heavy rainfall in the worst affected region was, a usual step in attribution analysis. The one data set including the event (MSWEP), suggests a 1 in 20 year event for daily rainfall over a very large region of eastern Spain. However, it is important to note that this does not represent the heaviest rainfall in certain regions that caused devastating floods, like Chiva, which received more than 400 l/sqm in less than 24 hours. This analysis thus serves as a first estimate of the role of human induced climate change.\n\n>To investigate if climate change influenced the heavy rainfall, we determine if there is a trend in the historic rainfall observations in the region,.The three analysed datasets indicate that heavy 1-day rainfall events, as intense as the one observed, are about 12% more intense and about twice as likely in today\u2019s climate, that is 1.3\u00b0C warmer than it would have been in the cooler preindustrial climate without human-caused warming.  \n\n>These results are based on observational data and do not include climate models that are used in full attribution studies. However, the results are in line with existing evidence of climate change signals in similar past extreme daily-rainfall events that have been studied across Europe. They are also aligned with  basic physics and the so-called Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, which outlines that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, resulting in a 7% increase in heavy rainfall with 1\u00b0C of warming. We are therefore confident the changes in heavy rainfall are driven by human-caused climate change. \n\nhttps://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-downpours-increasing-in-southern-spain-as-fossil-fuel-emissions-heat-the-climate/"

The chemical they\u2019re talking about, Methanethiol, may create more aerosols, which help cool the planet, but there are other factors.   The article does touch on them with the discussion on \u201cocean biodiversity\u201d.  The phytoplankton create this chemical, but the phytoplankton struggle in acidic environments, and absorbed CO2 causes acidity in our oceans.  In this regard, we may have been seeing this cooling effect all along, but it could be less effective, as oceans are acidifying.\n\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2015/ocean-acidification-phytoplankton-0720\n\n\u201cAs the uptake of carbon dioxide has increased in the last century, so has the acidity of oceans worldwide. Since pre-industrial times, the pH of the oceans has dropped from an average of 8.2 to 8.1 today. Projections of climate change estimate that by the year 2100, this number will drop further, to around 7.8 \u2014 significantly lower than any levels seen in open ocean marine communities today.\u201c\n\u2026\n\u201cBy 2100, the local composition of the oceans may also look very different due to warming water: The model predicts that many phytoplankton species will move toward the poles. That means that in New England, for instance, marine communities may look very different in the next century.\u201d"

But, if my math is right, this means that the global temperature has increased by 0.53 degrees Celsius in a single decade, after averaging 0.13 degrees in the previous twelve decades. Even if you go back another decade (when the temperature barely budged), that's still an average of 0.3C per decade, or 0.03C per year. . In other words, temperatures are increasing more than twice as fast in the 21st century than the 20th. If this keeps up, then we'll hit the 2.0C increase in 13 years at most. \n\nSomething's going on besides the first-order effects of carbon release. The feedback loops that we knew were coming are obviously here, and probably accelerating. If they are then we'll hit 2.0C in less than a decade, perhaps much less. We're off to the races."

                "Content": ">Is it too late to prevent climate change?  \n        \n>Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries.  \n             \n>The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.    \n           \n>Earth Will Continue to Warm and the Effects Will Be Profound  \n           \n>Global climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.   \n         \n>... climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.        \n        \n>Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.  \n           \n>The severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.   \n        \n>\u201cThe scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will miss the brief, rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future. \u2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  \n        \n>Here are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:  \n      \n>**U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100** ... Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.     \n        \n>**Climate Changes Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond**     \n       \n>**Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense** \u2014 Scientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm.\n          \n>**More Droughts and Heat Waves**\u2014 Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent.  \n        \n>**Longer Wildfire Season** \u2014 Warming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.   \n        \n>**Changes in Precipitation Patterns** \u2014 Climate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.  \n        \n>**Frost-Free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen** \u2014 The length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.   \n       \n>**Global Temperatures Will Continue to Rise**      \n       \n>**Arctic Is Very Likely to Become Ice-Free** \u2014 Sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.  \n       \n>**U.S. Regional Effects** \u2014 **Northeast** ... **Northwest** ... **Southeast** ... **Midwest** ... **Southwest** ...  \n         \n>**Page Last Updated:&nbsp;last month**"

Because climate feedbacks and future projections have large model uncertainties that overwhelm the uncertainties in greenhouse gas measurements, we present here an observationally based index that is proportional to the change in the warming influence since the onset of the industrial revolution (also known as climate forcing) supplied from these gases. This index is based on the observed amounts of long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere so contains little uncertainty.   \n       \n> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate forcing as \u201cAn externally imposed perturbation in the radiative energy budget of the Earth climate system, e.g. through changes in solar radiation, changes in the Earth albedo, or changes in atmospheric gases and aerosol particles.\u201d Thus, climate forcing is a \u201cchange\u201d in the status quo, forcing changes in the climate. IPCC takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline. The perturbation to climate forcing (also termed \u201cradiative forcing\u201d) that has the largest magnitude and the smallest scientific uncertainty is the forcing related to changes in the atmospheric global abundance of long-lived, well mixed, greenhouse gases, in particular, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and halogenated compounds (mainly CFCs)."

After 7 years of monitoring populations across 13 Alaskan nesting colonies, US Fish & Wildlife realized they hadn\u2019t fully grasped the scale of what was happening.\n\nResearch found more than half of Alaska common murres died, 4 million, in the largest mortality event of any non-fish vertebrate wildlife species reported during the modern era. Killings were an order of magnitude larger than hundreds of thousands perishing in the 1989 Exxon Valdez Alaskan oil spill.\n\nSome populations of such forage fish collapsed during the heat wave as north Pacific temps spiked 2.5 to 3\u00b0C above normal. Many predators that rely on them suffered. The number of Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska crashed 80% between 2013-2017, leading to temporary Alaska commercial fishery closures\n\nThe study compared a seven-year period (2008-2014) before the marine heat wave and another seven-year stretch afterward (2016-2022) and found that murre numbers fell 52% to 78% at 13 colonies across two large marine ecosystems in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld7bv65znk2x](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld7bv65znk2x)"

The councle just dumped most of them in dumpsters because they were stinking up the beaches.\n\nNever saw a live one again after that.\n\nEven offered bodies and recorded info to various museums.

Kind of a personal rant but I'm open to advice too because god knows I need it rn.\n\nI'm a junior in college studying climatology in the US. Like many of you, I've really been struggling with the election results. Obviously, Trump's climate policies won't be good, but we don't really know how bad it will get either.\n\nI won't quit climatology. No way. But I don't understand how we're supposed to function under this administration.\n\nI asked my research advisor about it, and he said that all we really do is just not mention climate change. I'm not really satisfied with this answer though (and also I don't think he knows how bad this could potentially get). Am I really just supposed to ignore the root cause of something just because some people don't like what I have to say because it might hurt their wallet? Quite frankly, I think that's bullshit.\n\nI'm supposed to be a scientist. You report what's real. Climate change is real. I will not sugarcoat anything because then I'm not doing my job as a scientist.\n\nDon't get me wrong I knew a 2nd Trump term was very possible, but now it's hitting me like a bag of bricks. It's always been my dream job to work with NOAA, but now that may not even be possible. I didn't even know if I wanted to get my PhD, but I think that decision has been made for me now. I've been thinking of going abroad for my masters (yes, I know many places abroad are bad right now too, but at least they're not dumb enough (or at least I think they're not) to deny climate change like we do here), and this has really amplified my desire. But that means leaving the life I have right now behind.\n\nI'm torn between my loved ones and my integrity as a scientist and its so frustrating, and all this frustration is just pent up inside of me and there's just nothing I feel like I can do with it. I start applying to grad school in fall 25, so I'll really only have 6 months to see what damage this administration will havoc.\n\nFor now, though, I'll do the best I can. Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: So many comments... I'll try to respond to as many as I can. Thanks guys :)\n\nAlso, a couple people are saying I have an \"agenda\" or a \"message\". No guys. I just like the weather and those things happen to be true. ",

I think we need to follow that line of discourse because the idea of a climate crisis  is not tangible\u2014yet\u2014to most people.

Now the curve is flattening and we'll max out at about 12 billion humans.\n\nThis is how GHGs are, just that we're still in the growth phase. Over the course of your career, GHG emissions will slow and plateau and we'll end up with a clearer picture where the climate is going and where it will eventually end up. That's the interesting part. \n\nWhat will flood intervals be in the eventual climate? Where will biomes move? What crops will thrive and where? Should we do geoengineering to slow the warming? There is so much cool climatology work needed in the future, and it goes way beyond activism and policy."

I think that being flexible with our energy usage is really important. It's about getting the most bang for your buck. I don't think though it is completely flexible.\n\nSolar also uses a lot of land.

Tandem cells could increase efficiency by another 50%. If that happens, it's game over, the future is ~100% solar.\n\n> I don't think it'll be significantly more efficient going forward.\n\nThat's probably true for the next 10 years at least.\n\n> I think the gains will come from battery storage but I also think we'll need other energy sources probably including nuclear.\n\nProbably not. Your view is based on the assumption that energy demand is inflexible (that people will pay any price to consume energy at any time). In reality, renewables are gradually increasing energy price volatility, and instead of paying higher prices people are finding ways to save (or make) money by changing how and when energy is consumed.\n\nBatteries can do this, but it requires dedicated hardware. In many cases, existing energy-consuming technology can serve the same role with little to no design changes. For example, commercial systems like HVAC and forges store energy in thermal reservoirs. Chemical production and supercomputer facilities are often energy-limited and can be throttled up and down depending on energy price.\n\nThe other factor is electrification and the growth of energy demand. As solar & wind get cheaper, they can displace fossil fuels for heating and enable new economic activity that was otherwise unprofitable. That means adding a lot of new variable-friendly energy demand, shrinking the relative baseload demand on the grid. It's not hard to imagine a 100% renewable grid with no batteries, where the entire industrial economy acts as a virtual power plant."

When those dissolve, the $$$ will tilt the playing field again towards fossil fuels.\n\nUsing nuclear as a stopgap means allowing foreign interests to control our fuel sources, as very little uranium is sourced in the US.\n\nAlso, the US electrical grid is not capable of charging so many EVs.  Currently, 75% of US EVs are charged via solar panels, but when those rich people all have EVs, the rest of us won\u2019t all be able to simply plug into the grid.  It would need massive investment, at the federal level, to succeed."

HVDC power lines lose about 3% per 1,000 km.  From New Mexico to southeastern Ohio would be enough for an improvement.  Arizona could bring in the western grid.  It is reasonable for Mexico and Canada to do an overland and undersea hook up between Baja and Quebec bypassing USA completely.  \n\nPetroleum companies can use cheap solar electricity to refine more gasoline at a lower cost.

Ice has an albedo of 0.5 to 0.7, whereas open ocean has an albedo of 0.06. This means that Ice reflects on average 10 times more sunlight back into space than the ocean does - meaning a melting ice cap results in 2-3 times more heat being absorbed at the poles per unit area.\n\nPreserving this ice is really important if we're to have a fighting chance against climate change."

Since the mid-1980s, the amount of thick, multi-year ice has shrunk by 95%. The ice that remains is young and thin. Some scientists predict the Arctic could have an ice-free summer as early as the 2030s.\n\nReal Ice\u2019s plan for protecting icy landscape inserts submersible pumps under sea ice to pump seawater onto the surface. The water freezes as it pools creating extra layers of ice. The process removes snow from the top of the ice, stripping insulating layers & triggering extra growth on the underside\n\nThe startup has conducted Arctic field tests for 2 years. The first were in Alaska, mostly to check equipment worked & could endure brutal cold. Cambridge Bay (Canada) tests started in January this year, covered 44,000 square feet of ice & added 20 inches of additional thickness between Jan & May\n\nAbridged (shortened) article\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld4z7xq2at2w](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld4z7xq2at2w)"

The planet is assuredly getting warmer, so Phoenix would be the main place to finger as both \"affected by climate change\" and \"people continuing to relocate there\".  It has always been hot in Phoenix, almost half the year 100+ F.  The current concern is lack of water, and regulations for it.  Some new neighborhoods have been built with no assured water supply, per a story in The Atlantic a few months ago.  \n\nMiami is hot and muggy, but is the only major city in the lower 48 U.S. which has never recorded a 100+ F temperature.  Good trivia for a cocktail party.  While Anchorage, AK has a record of only 90 F, Fort Yukon hit 100 F in 1915.  Pahala on Big Island, HI hit 100 F in 1931."

                "Content": "Thanks for the reply with links.  I was just thinking of CA up to San Fran.  Far north CA, OR, and WA rarely have concerns of less water.  Plot shows only 1 strong and 3 moderate AR's from SD to SF in 2024.  2023 had 4 strong ones.  What is a \"weak AR\"?  Just a little fog and drizzle?  Might not even make the news.\n\nThe eastern U.S. is affected mainly by humidity from the Gulf of Mexico.  As I stated, winds flow eastward, so the Atlantic Ocean has little effect, other than rare occasions when the winds reverse.  Unlike the west coast, beach cities on the east coast of FL are not appreciably cooler than inland cities.  You can clearly see the effect of the Gulf in satellite views.  The \"Dry Line\" runs just west of Dallas, thru the center of OK, KS, and NB.  When driving west, you see the landscape suddenly change from trees to grass.\n\nAll the papers you link which discuss AR's in the eastern U.S. define an AR as a front 500 miles wide, as in Fig. 5 of your 2nd link.  Ditto for the other links.  The AR's in CA are only 50 miles wide or even more focused.  I prefer eastern U.S. events termed \"front\" rather than \"river\", but feel free to molest terms however you choose if it gains you academic funding."

It mentions how a majority of the DOE budget is for nuclear: energy, weapons safety, non-proliferation, etc. it is a recurring theme that his secretary picks have no idea what their departments actually do, and many lose interest in even managing them. A best, worst case scenario this history repeats."

                "Content": "You should read Chris Wright\u2019s articles or listen to his talks on LinkedIn or YouTube. He is a guy who very much has a strong opinion on energy systems - not just nuclear weapons. \n\nI will boil it down to a single sentence: the world consumes so much energy that replacing hydrocarbons with renewables would be way too hard and costly, and counterproductive to economic growth, so it\u2019s stupid to make any attempt. \n\nIn his worldview, energy poverty is far more of a pressing concern than climate change (which he views as a hoax), and the answer is more energy from \u201creliable\u201d sources, ie natural gas and oil.\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong that the world consumes a staggering amount of energy, which of course comes mostly from the hydrocarbon-based energy systems we spent the last 300 years building. And he\u2019s not wrong that industrial processes require heat which today comes almost entirely from fuel combustion.  And he\u2019s not wrong that many success stories of nation state level GHG reductions have come less from successful sustainability programs and more from offshoring dirty processes.  But the lack of curiosity and ambition he displays for how America can and should show leadership in a transformation of these energy systems is deeply unfortunate for our planet. \n\nLike many successful and wealthy people, he seems to attribute his professional success to his own infallible brilliance. And he firmly believes that the answer to the world\u2019s problems comes in the form of the product he sells, hydrocarbons."

                "Content": "I wish this were the least probable, but the logic follows that this was the likeliest outcome.\n\nHumans are short term, reactionary animals that are highly susceptible to social propaganda. Combine that with the poor global economy following years of growth, amplified by Russian and Chinese intelligence infrastructure, and you will understand why the progressive incumbents of most countries on Earth just lost their re-election bids to challenger conservatives / authoritarians.\n\nTrump winning was my prediction, even though I am strongly averse to him. Now, he is consolidating power by selecting people who are incentivized to obey and serve him. \n\nElon Musk openly stated he would go to prison if Trump lost, so Trump brought the controllable tycoon into the fold to control him. Same with Ramaswany. He chose a loyalist Fox News speaker who can\u2019t afford negative PR for the military, and now an oil executive heavily invested in keeping their cabinet seat for energy.\n\nTrump is playing the game very, very well. He does not trust others, and is selecting people whose incentives he can control and align with his own personal gain. Textbook corporate executive."

No it's dumb disgusting farmers.\n\nPoor bird population dropping because farmers sealing grain stores but it was required under government rules, that ignores the impact of ramblers/dog walkers going through areas of ground nesting birds or the number of people with cats.\n\nCan't an remember which chemical (not roundup) but again farmers blamed but the quantities required would have required a 200% run off from fields, nobody went after highways, airports etc who were prolific users.\n\nGetting to glyphosate (roundup) there is a study to look into how washing powders in Europe contain parent chemicals that break down into it, is it used too much in agriculture, highly likely but one of the reasons is it helps the grain dry so requires less energy (dryers tend to be gas powered)to dry.\n\nAntibiotics in livestock, well a friend who is organic had to look at ways to reduce theirs further as UK conventional farmers have already reached targets as far as I'm aware. And let's not mention that our sewage treatment plants don't remove drugs from the water, hell how much of our wildlife is on the birth control pill because that ain't removed.\n\nBadgers, do we hear anything in the mainstream about how hedgehog numbers have increased where the badger cull has gone, does anyone care again about the ground nesting birds or the wild bees, yeah No1 cares about the badgers eating them, it's all down to farmers.\n\nDoes this mean I think farmers are all innocent nah certain parts of agriculture ain't ideal for wildlife, I've seen the foxgloves in hedgerows reduce but I would say a far amount is due to being forced through numerous routes towards monoculturism, lower labour means time saving equipment than older methods like hedgelaying.\n\nBill gates and his ilk are evil, they are rich therefore knows best and the rest of us don't deserve a choice."

The single biggest Department of Commerce agency outside of decennial census years is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and other components. NOAA garners $6.5 billion of the department\u2019s $12 billion annual operational budget and accounts for more than half of the department\u2019s personnel in non-decadal Census years (2021 figures).\"\n\n>\u2022 NOAA consists of six main offices:  \n\n>\u2022 The National Weather Service (NWS);  \n\n>\u2022 The National Ocean Service (NOS);  \n    \n>\u2022 The Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR);  \n    \n>\u2022 The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS);  \n\n>\u2022 The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); and  \n\n>\u2022 The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and NOAA Corps.    \n        \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; Together, these form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity. This industry\u2019s mission emphasis on prediction and management seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable. That is not to say NOAA is useless, but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.  \n         \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; NOAA today boasts that it is a provider of environmental information services, a provider of environmental stewardship services, and a leader in applied scientific research. Each of these functions could be provided commercially, likely at lower cost and higher quality.  \n         \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; **Focus the NWS on Commercial Operations.** Each day, Americans rely on weather forecasts and warnings provided by local radio stations and colleges that are produced not by the NWS, but by private companies such as AccuWeather. Studies have found that the forecasts and warnings provided by the private companies are more reliable than those provided by the NWS.^2  \n  \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; The NWS provides data the private companies use and should focus on its data-gathering services. Because private companies rely on these data, the NWS should fully commercialize its forecasting operations.  \n    \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; NOAA does not currently utilize commercial partnerships as some other agencies do. Commercialization of weather technologies should be prioritized to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested in the most cost-efficient technologies for high quality research and weather data. Investing in different sizes of commercial partners will increase competition while ensuring that the government solutions provided by each contract is personalized to the needs of NOAA\u2019s weather programs.   \n    \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; The NWS should be a candidate to become a Performance-Based Organization to better enforce organizational focus on core functions such as efficient delivery of accurate, timely, and unbiased data to the public and to the private sector.^3  \n         \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; **Review the Work of the National Hurricane Center and the National Environmental Satellite Service.** The National Hurricane Center and National Environmental Satellite Service data centers provide important public safety and business functions as well as academic functions, and are used by forecasting agencies and scientists internationally. Data continuity is an important issue in climate science. Data collected by the department should be presented neutrally, without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate.   \n       \n>[PDF, [p. 676](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042/project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise.pdf#page=708)]&nbsp;&nbsp; _Withdraw the 30x30 Executive Order and Associated America the Beautiful Initiative_. The 30x30 Executive Order and the American the Beautiful Initiative are\nbeing used to advance an agenda to close vast areas of the ocean to commercial activities, including fishing, while rapidly advancing offshore wind energy development to the detriment of fisheries and other existing ocean-based industries.   \n       \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify Regulations Implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. These acts are currently being abused at a cost to fisheries and Native American subsistence activities around the U.S.  \n          \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; **Downsize the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.** OAR provides theoretical science, as opposed to the applied science of the National Hurricane Center. OAR is, however, the source of much of NOAA\u2019s climate alarmism. The preponderance of its climate-change research should be disbanded. OAR is a large network of research laboratories, an undersea research center, and several joint research institutes with universities. These operations should be reviewed with an aim of consolidation and reduction of bloat.   \n        \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; **Break Up the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and Reassign Its Assets to Other Agencies During This Process.** The Office of Marine and\nAviation Operations, which provides the ships and planes used by NOAA agencies, should be broken up and its assets reassigned to the General Services Administration or to other agencies.  \n       \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; **Ensure Appointees Agree with Administration Aims.** Scientific agencies like NOAA are vulnerable to obstructionism of an Administration\u2019s aims if political appointees are not wholly in sync with Administration policy. Particular attention must be paid to appointments in this area.  \n       \n>[PDF, [p. 678](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042/project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise.pdf#page=710)]&nbsp;&nbsp; The Census Bureau\u2019s core mission is to execute the executive branch\u2019s constitutional mandate to conduct a census every 10 years, but its activities have steadily grown and shifted to include the economic census, American Communities Survey, and further functions outside of its core mission.  \n      \n>&nbsp;&nbsp; An incoming conservative Administration should focus on three areas: day-to-day management, the decennial census, and other programs. Each of these will need to be addressed at every stage of the transition and policy implementation process and will require that both committed political appointees and like-minded career employees are in immediately put in place to execute a conservative agenda. These will need to be placed both in the Census Bureau and in key department-level managerial positions, such as those in the CFO/ASA\u2019s office.  \n       \n>[PDF, [p. 680](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042/project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise.pdf#page=712)] \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; **Add a citizenship question.** Despite finding that the Trump Administration\u2019s addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census violated the Administrative Procedures Act, the Supreme Court held that the Secretary of Commerce does have broad authority to add a citizenship question to the decennial census. Any successful conservative Administration must include a citizenship question in the census. Asking a citizenship question is considered best practice even by the United Nations. By law, the Census Bureau must deliver the decennial census subjects/topics to Congress three years before Census Day (in this case, by April 1, 2027). Questions must be presented to Congress two years before Census Day (April 1, 2028).   \n               \nThe groundwork will be laid to transform the US into a fascist state, with one supreme ruler above the law ruling over the country, every individual in the country, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Congress, conceivably with the supreme ruler obtaining personal loans by trickery for hundreds of billions of dollars from the U.S.Treasury that will never have to be repaid, and the supreme ruler having the power of life and death over every person in the US, like Putin has inside and outside Russia, like Xi Jinping has in communist China, like Kim Jong Un has inside and outside North Korea, and like Mohammed bin Salman has inside and outside Saudi Arabia. As far as anyone knows, Trump's security forces could abduct his enemies in the dead of night and disappear them. Conceivably, the day eventually could come when Trump and the Fox network produce televised public executions held in places like the National Mall in Washington, DC and other outdoor areas managed by the U.S. National Park Service. Unfortunately, with tens of millions asleep at the wheel, the worst apparently is yet to come."

And despite planting in April, I didn't actually start seeing fruiting in any meaningful quantity until OCTOBER. So somethings up that's worse than just a warming temperature incline, and it's likely directly related, but if it's this bad now, I dread what the next decade will bring. If the outer shelf of Thwaites breaks off in the next few years, that's a whole foot and a half of continuous sea level rise over 9 months of melting the chunks that float out to sea, and then every year more of the glacier just rolls into the ocean creating a slower incline of rise until the next big part caves."

Even in my relatively short life I\u2019m noticing how it\u2019s taking weeks if not months longer to start snowing, and summers are way hotter. My parents spent the whole summer complaining about how it wasn\u2019t very hot, but we live in a temperate region. We aren\u2019t going to have the average temperatures of places like Arizona. Speaking of which, regions which do get way hotter are literally frying. I just don\u2019t understand how people can be so dense and blind.\n\nIt\u2019s really saddening how people are so selfish. They think they make no impact themselves so they decide to live blissfully in ignorance. This mindset perpetuates the problem, and while large corporations are the biggest culprit by far, that doesn\u2019t mean the billions of people on the planet couldn\u2019t make even the slightest impact with changes in their personal lives. I\u2019m constantly second guessing studying environmental science because the people I\u2019m spending money on earning a degree to help don\u2019t even believe in all the detrimental effects we\u2019re causing the environment.

                "Content": ">An international team of scientists using observations from NASA-German satellites found evidence that Earth\u2019s total amount of freshwater dropped abruptly starting in May 2014 and has remained low ever since. Reporting in Surveys in Geophysics, the researchers suggested the shift could indicate Earth's continents have entered a [persistently drier phase](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-024-09860-w \"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-024-09860-w\").&nbsp; [Open access article. No paywall]  \n           \n>From 2015 through 2023, satellite measurements showed that the average amount of freshwater stored on land \u2014 that includes liquid surface water like lakes and rivers, plus water in aquifers underground \u2014 was 290 cubic miles (1,200 cubic km) lower than the average levels from 2002 through 2014, said Matthew Rodell, one of the study authors and a hydrologist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \u201cThat\u2019s two and a half times the volume of Lake Erie lost.\u201d  \n           \n>During times of drought, along with the modern expansion of irrigated agriculture, farms and cities must rely more heavily on groundwater, which can lead to a cycle of declining underground water supplies: freshwater supplies become depleted, rain and snow fail to replenish them, and more groundwater is pumped. The reduction in available water puts a strain on farmers and communities, potentially leading to famine, conflicts, poverty, and an increased risk of disease when people turn to contaminated water sources, according to a [UN report on water stress](https://www.unesco.org/reports/wwdr/en/2024 \"https://www.unesco.org/reports/wwdr/en/2024\") published in 2024.    \n          \n>[Global [map](https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/waterstorage-grc-2023-1440px.jpg?w=2048&format=webp \"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/waterstorage-grc-2023-1440px.jpg?w=2048&format=webp\")]&nbsp; &nbsp; This map shows the years that terrestrial water storage hit a 22-year minimum (i.e., the land was driest) at each location, based on data from the GRACE and GRACE/FO satellites. A significantly large portion of the global land surface reached this minimum in the nine years since 2015, which happen to be the nine warmest years in the modern temperature record.\nImage by NASA Earth Observatory/Wanmei Liang with data courtesy of Mary Michael O\u2019Neill  \n       \n>Global warming leads the atmosphere to hold more water vapor, which results in more extreme precipitation, said NASA Goddard meteorologist Michael Bosilovich. While total annual rain and snowfall levels may not change dramatically, long periods between intense precipitation events allow the soil to dry and become more compact. That decreases the amount of water the ground can absorb when it does rain.   \n      \n>\u201cThe problem when you have extreme precipitation,\u201d Bosilovich said, \u201cis the water ends up running off,\u201d instead of soaking in and replenishing groundwater stores. Globally, freshwater levels have stayed consistently low since the 2014-2016 El Ni\u00f1o, while more water remains trapped in the atmosphere as water vapor. \u201cWarming temperatures increase both the evaporation of water from the surface to the atmosphere, and the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere, increasing the frequency and intensity of drought conditions,\u201d he noted.  \n        \n>While there are reasons to suspect that the abrupt drop in freshwater is largely due to global warming, it can be difficult to definitively link the two ...   \n          \n>It remains to be seen whether global freshwater will rebound to pre-2015 values, hold steady, or resume its decline. Considering that the nine warmest years in the modern temperature record coincided with the abrupt freshwater decline, Rodell said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a coincidence, and it could be a harbinger of what\u2019s to come.\u201d"

There are various factors (such as ocean sequestration of CO2) which are analogous to the wind.\n\n\nIn fact!  If we go even further, we're assuming the car is on level ground.

Then he explores the question of whether we should make machines to prevent that - like bombs or spacecraft to destroy or to reposition the asteroid before it hits earth.\n\nHe makes the argument that humans do not *deserve* such machines because it is more likely that such machines will be used by evil people to *cause* catastrophe than to protect us from it.\n\nExtrapolating from there, I think that, even if humans could harness interstellar travel and colonize other planets, we would eventually destroy those new planet as we are destroying this one. Thus, I think that human's only chance of survival as a species in the long run is to evolve beyond our own selfish and greedy nature. I hope that we eventually do that.\n\nTo that end, we have a long ways to go. Just think about how outraged people get at the idea of restricting reproduction, even though this planet already includes eight billion humans and can sustainably support only two billion."

A brief search found this on [her Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom):\n\n> It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and they become used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.\n\nI would like to explore her work in more detail, but on first glance, I would argue that cooperation is possible in small societies and almost impossible inside *and between* huge and diverse societies (as modern countries are).\n\nHowever, if doing the right thing for the commons (in this case, the global climate) is also in the best interest of individuals, then it can work. This is why I am glad to see technology like electric cars, e-bikes, and sustainable energy becoming cheaper and better than the fossil-fuel-dependent technologies that they replace."

                "Content": "From Chat GPT:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"Can you describe a strategy to transition to a low cost electricity generation technology that minimizes impact of the cost of stranded assets on companies that generate electricity?\"\n\n----\n\n**Response:**\n\nTransitioning to low-cost electricity generation technologies while minimizing the financial impact of stranded assets requires a thoughtful strategy. Here\u2019s an outline of a viable approach:\n\n\\1. Policy and Regulatory Support\n----\n* Market Incentives: Create mechanisms like feed-in tariffs, carbon pricing, or tax credits for renewable energy to incentivize investment in low-cost technologies.\n\n* Transition Compensation: Establish government-backed funds to help companies recover part of the value of stranded assets, mitigating financial losses.\n\n* Phase-Out Timelines: Define clear, gradual timelines for decommissioning high-cost or carbon-intensive generation assets to allow companies to adjust their operations strategically.\n\n\\2. Asset Repurposing\n----\n* Retrofitting Existing Infrastructure: Explore converting older generation facilities to new technologies, such as retrofitting coal plants to biomass or integrating hydrogen production into gas plants.\n\n* Redeploying Facilities: Utilize existing sites for new generation technologies, taking advantage of existing transmission and grid connections.\n\n* Energy Storage: Convert retired facilities into energy storage hubs (e.g., battery storage or pumped hydro) to support grid reliability.\n\n\\3. Investment in Renewable Energy\n----\n* Joint Ventures: Encourage partnerships between traditional utilities and renewable energy developers to share risks and accelerate deployment of low-cost technologies.\n\n* Portfolio Diversification: Shift investment gradually to build a diversified portfolio that includes renewable generation, storage, and grid services, reducing reliance on legacy assets.\n\n* Corporate PPAs: Promote long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with businesses seeking renewable energy, providing steady revenue streams for new projects.\n\n\\4. Stranded Asset Mitigation\n----\n* Depreciation Acceleration: Accelerate the depreciation of fossil fuel assets on the books to align with transition timelines and reduce the economic shock.\n\n*  Secondary Markets: Develop markets for selling or repurposing equipment and expertise associated with high-cost technologies.\n\n*  Stakeholder Engagement: Involve financial institutions and investors in managing stranded asset risk through transparent planning and disclosure.\n\n\\5. Grid Modernization and Flexibility\n----\n*  Smart Grids: Invest in grid modernization to integrate variable renewable energy sources efficiently.\n\n*  Demand Response Programs: Enhance demand-side management to balance supply from renewables and reduce reliance on traditional peaking plants.\n\n*  Interconnection Projects: Build interregional transmission lines to distribute renewable energy more effectively, leveraging diverse generation patterns.\n\n\\6. Workforce Transition Programs\n----\n* Reskilling Initiatives: Provide training and education programs for workers transitioning from fossil fuel-based roles to jobs in renewable energy and grid services.\n\n* Community Investment: Focus on economic development in regions dependent on legacy energy industries, ensuring a just transition for impacted communities.\n\n\\7. Long-Term Strategic Planning\n----\n* Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs): Require utilities to prepare IRPs that prioritize cost-effective, sustainable energy generation.\n\n* Scenario Analysis: Conduct regular assessments of market trends, technological advancements, and policy developments to adapt transition strategies dynamically.\n\n* Stakeholder Collaboration: Engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, and communities to ensure aligned goals and shared responsibility.\n\n----\n\nBy combining policy, innovation, and financial mechanisms, this strategy allows electricity generation companies to transition responsibly, reducing the burden of stranded assets while aligning with the shift to low-cost, sustainable energy."

I am pretty sure that is intentional. The fossil fuel industry continues to make profit as they deny, delay, and doubt.\n\nAnd now (assuming this claim is true) that China is getting it done, that talking point has even *less* validity.\n\nI think that another key point here is that, as the developed world (including China) reduces greenhouse gases, it can improve the technologies involved and get economies of scale, so that when we ask developing nations (including India) to get on board, the technology will be affordable for them."

And a huge part of our alfalfa production is Saudi-owned and doesn\u2019t even feed US livestock. I\u2019m guessing you know this but someone else might not! \n\nWish I could include pics in comments, but this infographic might be illustrative to others:\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/1mjepZyhzhFbd8nY9"

The Mango Mussolini implemented parts of Project 2025 in his first term:\n\n* He installed incompetent partisan loyalists in federal institutions, including the courts. Those loyalists on the SCOTUS have since given themselves the power to make the POTUS above the law.\n\n* He declared that he \"can do anything\" (i.e., \"unitary executive\").\n\n* He legislated by executive order, bypassing the Congress in violation of the Constutition. Examples: Bump Stock ban and Border Wall.\n\n* He tried to withhold federal funds from states (and foreign allies) to extort political favors.\n\n* He used the DoJ as his private police force and law firm.

                "Content": "Chat gpt summary:\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, there were concerns about how the next four years could impact climate change efforts. Under Biden, the US made significant strides, rejoining the Paris Agreement, setting ambitious emission goals, and enacting substantial climate investment through laws like the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden\u2019s presidency saw policies to cut emissions across power plants, vehicles, and infrastructure, pushing for a 50% reduction by 2030.\n\nA Trump presidency, however, is likely to reverse many of these actions. Trump has pledged to withdraw from the Paris Agreement again and potentially undo significant parts of Biden\u2019s climate policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act and EV tax credits. Analysts suggest that a Trump presidency could lead to 4 billion metric tons more CO\u2082 emissions by 2030 than under a continued Biden term. This shift could mean the US will miss its 2030 climate targets, pushing global warming limits further out of reach.\n\nGoing forward, the US may see less international climate engagement and more challenges in advancing domestic climate policy, impacting global efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C."

Our researchers forecast that average battery prices could fall towards $80/kWh by 2026, amounting to a drop of almost 50% from 2023, a level at which battery electric vehicles would achieve ownership cost parity with gasoline-fueled cars in the US on an unsubsidized basis. \n\nThose prices are for complete packs.  So a 75kWh pack would cost the car manufacturer $6k, 2023 cost for the same pack would be $11,175"

The repercussions will be astronomical. Last time he was in office he withdrew from more than 100 environmental protections. Will he pull from these again? The short answer is yes. This affects the entire planet not just the US. The aim of the Paris agreement was to have zero net emissions by 2050, at least this is what Joe Biden envisioned. \n\nWhere do we go from here? ",

                "Content": "Before anyone says the Great Lakes region is a \u201cclimate haven\u201d, as someone who grew up there, I can assure you it\u2019s not, and this leads to damaging thinking.\n\nThe Great Lakes region was engulfed in smoke from wildfires, and had some of its own with how dry it has been. In 2023 the area got blanketed in smoke so bad it smelled like burning tires everywhere and it was enough to alter the sunlight to an eerie orange gray color. It was at one point the most polluted air quality in the entire world.\n\nNot only that, erosion, infighting with locals and refugees, and lack of high incomes will make the region politically and geographically unstable. There are also massive oil pipes that need replacement inside Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Erie but businesses and governments around the lakes refuse to fix it. We also have a big problem with companies like Nestle and city governments drawing more than their fair share of water. It\u2019s not a good situation.\n\nI also know the Great Lakes region is much more sparsely populated and actually contains impressive wilderness. This is part of the reason why it\u2019s been called a \u201cclimate haven\u201d. Cities aren\u2019t good for the environment and there aren\u2019t nearly as many cities as other areas.\n\nIt may be \u201cbetter\u201d than Florida but it\u2019s no climate haven.\n\n\nThe Great Lakes are ecologically in danger as well due to human activity\u2026the region is only getting attention now simply because it\u2019s become too expensive to do business elsewhere. Without changing our habits this area will befall the same fate as every other area.\n\n\nWe need to stop thinking of areas as havens because it gives us an excuse to pollute more. We need to minimize damage now and enact change ASAP.\n\nIf we don\u2019t change then get used to this, this is what collapse of a society looks like. Very gradually but still collapsing."

                "Content": "> Cities aren\u2019t good for the environment\n\nEhh it's more \"the way we typically build cities aren't good for the environment\".   We can build cities that minimize negative climate impacts but we have to dramatically shift our perspective on success and cultural norms here in America.\n\nCities cannot be car centric places with massive amounts of space dedicated to parking and asphalt.  We cannot have large individual home lots zoned exclusively for single family houses.  We cannot have wasteful grass lawns that harm biodiversity.  We'll need to have much more tree canopy and greenspaces dispersed through our cities.   We'll need to have people using public transit, walking, cycling more and driving significantly less. \n\nProperly build cities that focus on smart density, car alternatives, and efficient use of space are probably our best bet for our climate woes.  This doesn't mean there are ZERO single family homes, but we need much more of [this](https://nhschicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1-Best-Superblock-After-photo-2048x1152.jpg)  sort of housing norms and far less of [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/sunday-review/15SPRAWLsub/15SPRAWLsub-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=478&w=600&s=82894b71a3c5fffd4c93d812404de9bb40aaf5e7a072202a9448b699effe2111&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1). \n\nThe latter is just untentable in terms of land use making places unreachable on foot. Requires so much more paved roadways worsening flooding since there is less ground for water to seep into.  It worsens urban heat island both from suburbia and in cities as we need to build massive amounts of surface parking to accomodate suburban commuters. It makes publc transit impractical leading to even more people having to drive for every trip, releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere.  It's just inefficient and is causing us so many long problems for the sake of \"convenience\" and the American Dream\u2122.  \n\nWe should have moved on decades ago but it's so baked into the fabric of this country that it's going to be a struggle to get folks to change their minds."

                "Content": "Extract from the report:\n\n**2.3\u00b0C by 2100, Peak CO2 about 500 ppm**\n\nCurrent NDCs are not sufficient to prevent significant overshoot of 1.5\u00b0C, with many governments delaying meaningful mitigation to 2040, 2050, or beyond. While perceived short-term as economically advantageous, for example lowering energy costs today, a slower transition from fossil fuels locks in widespread future loss and damage from the cryosphere for decades and centuries, with adaptation needs far higher and more expensive where still technically feasible.\n\n*Ice Sheets and Sea-level Rise:*\n\nA compelling number of new studies, taking into account ice dynamics, paleo-climate records from Earth\u2019s past and recent observations of ice sheet behavior point to thresholds for both Greenland and parts of Antarctica well below 2.2\u00b0C. Many ice sheet scientists now believe that exceeding even 1.5\u00b0C will be sufficient to melt large parts of Greenland and West Antarctica, and potentially vulnerable portions of East Antarctica; generating inexorable sea-level rise that exceeds 10 meters in the coming centuries, even if air temperatures are later decreased.\n\nThe pace of this long-term, unstoppable sea-level rise will pose major long-term persistent challenges for all coastal regions; and result in widespread loss and damage of critical infrastructure (about 75% of all cities with >5 million inhabitants exist below 10 meters\u2019 elevation), agricultural land, and the livelihoods of all those who depend upon these at-risk regions.\n\n\n**3\u20133.5\u00b0C and CO2 about 650 ppm by 2100**\n\nIf atmospheric CO2 continues to increase at today\u2019s pace, which has not paused despite current mitigation pledges, global temperatures will reach at least 3\u00b0C by the end of this century. Loss and damage from cryosphere at this level will be extreme, well beyond limits of adaptation for many communities and nations.\n\n*Ice Sheets and Sea-level Rise:*\n\nOnce 3\u00b0C is passed, ice loss from Greenland and especially from West Antarctica becomes extremely rapid. Together with extensive ice loss from parts of East Antarctica, the IPCC could not rule out that three meters might be passed early in the 2100s; with five meters passed by 2200 and up to 15 m of sea-level rise possible by 2300. While seemingly in the far future, this massive scale of coastal destruction will have been made inevitable by decisions made in the next few decades, causing temperatures to pass these critical thresholds.\n\n\n**1.5\u00b0C Consistent Pathways, Peak CO2 about 430 ppm**\n\nOnly this pathway can slow cryosphere losses to rates that enable feasible adaptation for many coastal and mountain communities especially, greatly minimizing loss and damage.\n\n*Ice Sheets and Sea-level Rise:*\n\nRate of sea-level rise would stabilize by 2100 because temperatures, while peaking at 1.6\u00b0C, have by then declined to around 1.4\u00b0C. This requires urgent action, however, with emergency-scale tightening of mitigation commitments and fossil fuel emissions declining 40% by 2030. Unfortunately, the latest science shows that even 1.5\u00b0C may not be sufficient to protect both ice sheets, with a best-case scenario that sea-level rise would slow, but continue. Should the planet remain at 1.5\u00b0C for too long (decades to centuries), substantial sea-level rise from Greenland, West Antarctica and possibly even East Antarctica may become locked in for several millennia. This has happened in the geological past when the planet reached +1.5\u00b0C due to slow changes in Earth\u2019s orbit, with sea levels 6\u20139 meters above today."

In the Northwest Passage, areas covered by sea ice in the summer were the lowest since records began.\n\n\u201cThe Arctic today, year after year, looks vastly different than it did 20 years ago.\u201d In the Arctic tundra, there have long been signs of a shift in how much carbon is moving between land & air. By incorporating more data & better analysis, scientists can now describe the trend with confidence.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2020, wildfires and thawing permafrost caused the tundra to release more carbon dioxide than its plants removed from the air, probably for the first time in many millenniums. How much this gap widens depends in large part on how much nations rein in greenhouse warming.\n\n\"What you need to know\" extended summary\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lcywipabzo2v](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lcywipabzo2v)"

There will be enormous amounts of damage and displaced people for excavation and the profit of some foreign country.  Not to mention the trillions of L of water that will be wasted in a country that is already short on water.\n\nAnd for what? New products that we buy.

[USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth#overview).     \n         \nThe volume of water in Earth's oceans (saline) is approximately 1,226,544 times greater than the ice volume in iceberg A23a.   \n         \nThe ice volume in iceberg A23a is equal to approximately 0.0000815% (0.000000815298522369) of the volume of water (saline) in Earth's oceans.    \n         \nIf a pile of sand has 1,226,545 grains of sand, all of the  grains have the same volume, and none of them are frozen, removing one of the grains of sand, freezing it, and throwing it back into the sand pile would have about as much effect on the temperature of the whole sand pile as throwing A23a into the ocean.   \n         \nA similar analogy can be made for the relatively tiny amount of anthropogenic CO2 emissions absorbed by the water in A23a after it has melted.   \n       \nUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) data indicates that the volume of water in Earth's oceans (saline) is [1,338,000,000](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-natural-water-there) cubic kilometers.  \n          \nAntarctic iceberg A23a weighs nearly a trillion tonnes, according to this [press release](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/worlds-largest-iceberg-a23a-breaks-free/) by the British Antarctic Survey on 13 December 2024.  \n         \nAn iceberg is glacier ice (frozen fresh water).

From the 1.5C threshold set to be breached for a full year for the first time, to the disappointment of vulnerable nations at this year's UN climate summit, it can feel like the challenge is overwhelming.\n\nBut this year also saw some extraordinary breakthroughs for climate and nature. In case you missed them, we have rounded up some of the biggest wins for our planet from the past year.\n\n1/ The end of coal in the UK\u2026  \nThe UK closed its last coal-fired power plant in 2024. It was a symbolic moment as the UK was the first country in the world to use coal for public power generation and the fossil fuel was the lifeblood of the industrial revolution.\n\n2/ \u2026and a global surge in green power  \nRenewable energy sources are growing rapidly around the world. In the US, wind energy generation hit a record in April, exceeding coal-fired generation. By the end of this decade, renewable energy sources are set to meet almost half of all electricity.\n\n3/ The rivers, mountains, waves and whales given legal personhood  \nBeyond Ecuador, a growing number of natural features & spaces were granted legal personhood in 2024. This year, a report was published which found such rulings can help protect endangered ecosystems.\n\n4/ New ocean protections for the Azores  \nOnce a new marine protected area (MPA) is established in the North Atlantic, it will be the largest in the region, spanning 30% of the sea around the Portuguese archipelago. Half of the 287,000 sq km will be \"fully protected,\" and the other \"highly protected.\"\n\n5/ Amazon deforestation reaches nine-year low  \nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon dropped to a nine-year low in 2024, falling by more than 30% in the 12 months to July, according to data released by Brazil's national space research institute, INPE.\n\n6/ Conservation really can make a difference to biodiversity  \nThe scientists reviewed 665 trials of conservation measures across the world, including several historic trials, and found they had had a positive effect in two out of every three cases.\n\n7/ Indigenous-led efforts replenish skies and rivers  \nIn California, wildlife has benefited from decades-long drives by the Native American Yurok Tribe to replenish animals on tribal territories. In 2024, this culminated in salmon returning to the Klamath River.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldik5tqyms2o](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ldik5tqyms2o)"

It\u2019s important to also focus on the good because it keeps people believing that we can still do something about it. The overwhelmingly negative news around climate change seems to create the opposite effect of what it hoped to do; people are getting tired of climate change news, stop believing in it, or believe it\u2019s all too late so why bother.

                "Content": "I do wind, solar, and batteries - but I focus on wind and solar. The technology for both is improving because the demand for tech is increasing. There is a lot of wind and solar waiting to be built. Large scale projects, 100MW and up, take years to develop but there have been many projects built this year. \n\nThe biggest battle the industry faces isn\u2019t actually the Trump administration, although obviously a democratic president would have been better for us.  The toughest fight is NIMBYism. Folks who aren\u2019t against it, per se, but don\u2019t want to look at it - solar panels or wind. Illinois, for example, broadly has laws against NIMBYs stopping a project \n\nFor example, in Wisconsin, a 1.3gigawatt project was recently approved - that was a huge win for the industry. It had 900 objectors - a LOT of people. And the State basically said \u201cyou not wanting to look at is not a good enough reason for this to not be built\u201d. Which is also a lesson in making sure you vote and fight for local/state elections as hard as you do for national elections. Almost all of these projects are permitted locally, very few are done federally. \n\nI hope this helps! You keep asking and I\u2019ll keep answering!"

Additionally, some specialty hops used by craft brewers have already become more difficult to source, as warm winters are producing earlier and smaller harvests.\"\n\nblueberries:\"Blueberries are dependent on the pollination of insects, especially bees, this correlation put them in a position of risk of extinction.

Overfishing harms marine ecosystems by reducing fish populations, upsetting food chains, and lowering biodiversity. Oceans help regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and heat, but overfishing can weaken this ability. Pesticides harm the environment by degrading soil, polluting water, and killing beneficial organisms like pollinators. Healthy soils and ecosystems store carbon and support biodiversit. Pesticides weaken these natural processes."

About 70% of Corn is fed to animals in CAFOs, same goes for a few other grains . 70% Of land is used to raise mostly human eatable food for Farm animals. Animal Ag uses more water then any other type of farming (That includes the water used for their food). (330 gal for 1  1/4 pound burger v 45 gal for plant burger) Animal Ag is a high resource endeavor. Animal Ag produces more GHGs then all of Transportation world wide. Most of that is Methane and Nitrous Oxide and they are more potent then Co2. Animal Ag produces more the half of the GHGs of the over all total of farming. Animal Ag is the number one reason for deforestation. Over fishing is the biggest reason for the depletion of fish stocks and ocean destruction. There is enough crop land to produce enough plant based food for 10 billion people. there is only around 8 billion now. There is over 8.5 billion farm animals. By switching to a more sustainable plant based diet we can feed more people on less land. Drought effect from climate change will be lass impactful on the crops especially when combined with No till and crop rotation farming."

The EEA has published the first ever [European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment) to help identify policy priorities for climate change adaptation and for climate-sensitive sectors.  \n             \n***    \n     \nThe following content is a slice of the 39-page EUCRA  [Executive Summary](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment) that is included with the 488-page [EUCRA full report](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/european-climate-risk-assessment-report), Published 11 Mar 2024.    \n        \n***    \n      \nEuropean Environment Agency - EUCRA - [Executive Summary](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment)&nbsp; ([PDF](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download)):  \n             \n>This assessment identifies 36 climate risks with potentially severe consequences across Europe.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 3, par. 1](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=3).]  \n              \n>\u2022 Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world. Extreme heat, once relatively rare, is becoming more frequent while precipitation patterns are changing. Downpours and other precipitation extremes are increasing in severity, and recent years have seen catastrophic floods in various regions. At the same time, southern Europe can expect considerable declines in overall rainfall and more severe droughts.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 3, par. 3](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=3).]    \n          \n>\u2022 When applying the scales of severity used in the European climate risk assessment, several climate risks have already reached critical levels. If decisive action is not taken now, most climate risks identified could reach critical or catastrophic levels by the end of this century. Hundreds of thousands of people would die from heatwaves, and economic losses from coastal floods alone could exceed EUR 1 trillion per year.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 3, par. 6](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=3).]      \n            \n>...Europe is the fastest-warming continent; since the 1980s, warming on the continent was about twice the global rate.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 5, par. 1](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=5).]  \n          \n>Recent years have seen many long-time climate records broken in Europe. Europe is also facing more and stronger climate hazards, including heatwaves and prolonged droughts, heavy precipitation leading to pluvial and fluvial floods, and sea level rise leading to coastal floods (see Figure ES.1).&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 5, par. 2](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=5).]    \n         \n>Most climate hazards in Europe will further increase during the 21st century, even under optimistic scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement, but the magnitude\nand pace of change depend on global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (see Figure ES.2). A pessimistic scenario without additional policy action suggests that economic damages related to coastal floods alone might exceed EUR 1 trillion per year by the end of the century in the EU.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 6, par. 1](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=6).]    \n       \n>Extreme heat is becoming increasingly common, exposing a large share of the population to heat stress, particularly in southern and western Europe. The record-hot summer of 2022 has been linked to between 60,000 and 70,000 premature deaths in Europe, despite considerable investments in heat-health action plans. Warmer temperatures also facilitate the northward movement of disease vectors and their spread to higher elevations. Southern Europe is now warm enough for mosquitoes to transmit formerly tropical diseases.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 6, par. 3](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=6).]  \n        \n>Heatwaves and prolonged droughts are growing with climate change. This can lead to acute crises, such as widespread wildfires, critical infrastructure failures,\nblackouts, and major health and economic impacts. Europe faces a growing risk of megadroughts that span large regions and last for several years, and that are\neven more severe than recent drought events in Europe. Prolonged droughts cause large economic damage across many sectors and can severely degrade the water resources that people, agriculture, industry, power plants, river transport and ecosystems depend on.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 7, par. 1](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=7).]  \n       \n>Extreme precipitation has increased in large parts of Europe, leading to growing flood risks and devastating floods in recent years. This trend is expected to rise further in a warming climate.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 7, par. 2](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=7).]  \n            \n>Sea level in Europe is rising higher every year at an accelerating pace. Rising sea levels increase the risk of coastal floods and storm surges, coastal erosion and\nsaltwater intrusion into groundwater. This presents an important threat to many coastal cities, regions and ecosystems in Europe. Sea level will continue to rise\nfor centuries or even millennia after global temperatures have stabilised.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 7, par. 3](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=7).]  \n            \n>Extreme precipitation and large-scale floods took place in Germany and Belgium in 2021 (EUR 44 billion damage and more than 200 deaths), Slovenia in 2023 (damage estimated at around 16% of national GDP), and Greece in 2023 (submerging its breadbasket region). These events caused severe, direct impacts on settlements, infrastructure, agriculture and human health. They also led to wider economic impacts in the affected regions and major fiscal challenges at national levels, and stretched the limits of the existing EU Solidarity Fund.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 7, par. 5](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=7).]  \n          \n>More than half (21 out of the 36) major climate risks for Europe identified in this report need more action now, with eight of them being particularly urgent. Urgent\naction is needed for risks from all policy clusters, indicating that policies need to increase in ambition, scope and implementation. A third of these risks need\nfurther investigation, including more research, better monitoring or a review of the policy framework.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 10, par. 5](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=10).]  \n      \n>Southern Europe, low-lying coastal regions and EU outermost regions are hotspot regions for climate risks. Southern Europe is particularly affected by heat and\nprolonged drought. Three out of the eight risks in the highest urgency category are evaluated with this high urgency score because of their high severity in southern Europe. In contrast, none of the other three sub-continental regions stand out as hotspots for climate risks in Figure ES.4. Low-lying, coastal regions are also\nhotspots because some risks with high severity and urgency are concentrated there. Finally, EU outermost regions are hotspots based on a separate risk assessment outlined below.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 10, par. 6](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=10).]  \n         \n>\u2022 Southern Europe is particularly at risk from the increasing impacts of heat and droughts on agricultural production, outdoor work, summer tourism and fire. Within southern Europe, rural areas and local economies dependent on ecosystem services are particularly at risk;&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 11, par. 5](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=11).]      \n       \n>\u2022 Low-lying coastal regions, including many densely-populated cities, are at risk from flooding, erosion and saltwater intrusion aggravated by sea level rise;&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 11, par. 6](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=11).]  \n        \n>Densely-populated, urban areas are at particular risk from heatwaves and extreme precipitation. The urban heat island effect can amplify the effects of heatwaves,\nparticularly at night. High amounts of soil sealing and limited green and blue spaces in the city increase the risk of flooding, especially during cloudbursts.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 11, par. 10](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=11).]  \n           \n>Due to limitations, current climate risk assessments tend to underestimate overall risk levels.&nbsp; [PDF, [p. 32, par. 4](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment/download#page=33).]"

                "Content": "The phrase \"drying out\" is misleading and oversimplifies the complexities of climate change. While the globe is warming, it doesn't necessarily mean the Earth is simply becoming drier. Rather, it is causing climate zones to shift in some regions, moving northward, and in others, expanding or intensifying. Canada, for example, will likely experience a warmer, more temperate climate as the boreal zone gradually shifts northward. This shift will bring longer growing seasons but also introduce new challenges, such as more extreme heat events and potential water scarcity in some areas.\n\nThe real challenge here is not climate change itself, but our resistance to adaptation. People often resist change, especially when it threatens the way of life they\u2019ve known for generations. For instance, if a region moves from a subtropical climate to a desert, it will directly impact agriculture, water access, and livelihoods, making it crucial to adapt our infrastructure, water management, and farming practices. The world is not going to turn into a giant ball of sand. While it\u2019s true that some areas may experience more arid conditions, other regions will face increased rainfall, and warmer temperatures could extend growing seasons in parts of the world that were once too cold for certain crops.\n\nThe real issue is the human ability to adapt to these changes. Humans have always adapted to new environments, whether through technological innovation, changing agricultural practices, or building resilient cities. But failure to adapt will have serious consequences. If we continue to ignore the signs of climate change and view it purely as the destruction of the Earth, we risk undermining our ability to thrive. Inaction can lead to societal collapse, as communities fail to adjust to shifting resources, extreme weather, and changing ecosystems.\n\nIn fact, adaptation is our only choice. Denying the reality of climate change or labeling it as the end of the world limits our ability to take the necessary steps toward preparing for a warmer, more volatile climate. Our future survival depends on embracing change, using our creativity and technological capabilities to mitigate harm and adapt to new conditions. Only through thoughtful adaptation can we ensure that humanity continues to thrive in the face of an ever-changing planet."

Emissions are a consequence but no emissions no energy from fossil fuels. Of course nuclear can replace the fossil fuel units. \n\nThe increase in atmospheric co2 due to our emissions have not increased the concentration to anywhere near historical levels."

                "Content": "Nope.  Just pointing out that at peak co2 50 million years ago - when it was 3000/4000 PPM - that was the actual temperature.  But sun brightness probably varies some over time - so - can't be too sure how that ties to this.  \n\nLook - I'm a pragmatist.  At the moment, we need a ton of oil.  That said, we could be transitioning a LOT faster than we are.  We spend 1.5 trillion/year on the military.  1/3 of that would speed the transit a whole lot.  And hey - I love Billy Bob Thornton and Landman is a great show.  But that crap he said about the carbon footprint of big Texas wind turbines - was total nonsense.  Power doesn't come any cleaner than what we get from wind.  And it is the cheapest form of power in Texas - around $25/MWH.  But - to be fair - like wind anywhere - comes more off peak. Couples pretty well with solar.  \n\nThe transmission grid was designed for large (1 GW sized) power plants.  But with a bit of effort - we can expedite the addition of lots of smaller power sources, wind and solar farms.  We just aren't doing it.  \n\nWe need a LOT more pumped storage as well.  These battery backup systems are great for frequency stability and very short term (4 hour) outages.  Real outages like we had there - the ice storm - hurricane beryl, these are a couple days to a couple weeks."

                "Content": "Most utility companies offer discounts for water filtration systems for those affected areas. Certain areas also have government programs. Assistance programs for the disadvantaged. \n\nI recommend folks to look into the water companies that run your utilities. Much of the clean water in the United States is run by for-profit companies that are overseen by utility commissions.\n\nYou can look at ETF\u2019s such as AQWA or PHO. Or specific utility companies AWK or MSEX or YORW\n\nThe other thing to look at is municipal bonds. Because that\u2019s partly what pays for our water infrastructure. Many times that stuff is tax deductible. There are variety of ETFs. New York and NYC specifically has been a popular tax/free municipal bond for a long time.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual PFAS? We need to look at inspiration from Ralph Nader and the clean air and water act. It was passed, but it has been bastardized since. And we need Congress to help.\n\nAdditionally, we need to talk to our local utilities commission. Get our state legislators involved.\n\nFreshwater is a resource. It looks like we\u2019re selling out to for profit companies rather than a government managed plan. Whatever they\u2019re offering? We need to be strategic about how we sell our freshwater to for-profit companies to sell it back to our people. And maybe the solution is grants and vouchers, just like air conditioners, and heat pumps except it\u2019s a de salinization and water filtration localized at every property"

The planetary boundaries create a safe range for humans to maintain a stable and resilient Earth. When a boundary is surpassed, the likelihood of permanently damaging Earth's life-support functions increases significantly. With each boundary crossed, the risk of irreversible damage rises even more.\n\n>Six of the nine planetary boundaries have already been violated, per the Potsdam Institute [report](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/earth-exceed-safe-limits-first-planetary-health-check-issues-red-alert), and if trends of ocean acidification continue as researchers have predicted, a seventh breach is not far behind.\n\n[https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/ocean-acidification-impacts-marine-life-climate-future/](https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/ocean-acidification-impacts-marine-life-climate-future/)\n\nEdit:  Note that apparently controversial sentence in the article, used in the headline, does NOT say the oceans will be sterilized in a few years or ever.  It says \"our oceans may no longer be capable of **properly** sustaining life or helping to regulate the Earth's climate...\"  \\[Boldface added.\\]  It would have been worded better to say that ocean degradation resulting from acidification may impair ocean life (and oxygen production) and the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide, compared to recent, proper levels.",

This staggering figure stems from the sheer scale of the motorsports ecosystem, with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of racing events of all types taking place globally each year, generating substantial emissions from the vehicles themselves as well as the transportation of both participants and fans to these competitions."

So yeah i stand corrected oops lol\n\nI have parents that try to be as ecologist as possible so I grew in an environnement where the climate change issue was always and will always be a real thing. \n\nBut I do not understand why people would call it fake Underestimating it's impacts on their lives because it didn't impact them yet that I can understand. \n\nBut denying it's existence with multiple proof and an overwhelming majority of scientist agreeing on the matter seems so weird to me ? \n\nJust why ? This question has been mind boggling to me. I do understand that a lot of people do prioritse the economy and other aspects over the environnement and I can kinda understand it especially if the effects didn't impact you yet due to human brain. (Like if doesn't impact me then it's no real until it impacts me). \n\nI dont understand what you gain by doing that. At worst just say you don't care and that's it. But actively trying to make it worse while denying it's existence is so weird to me\n\nDid anyone had a the chance to discuss that with someone that doesn't believe in it ? Like that was actually opened to discussion and not telling that \"you're a sheep controlled by the government\"?\n\n\n",

They have literally built networks of tens of thousands of people across North America earning 6 figure salaries JUST to pass money to other organizations who in turn pass money to other organizations, who in turn pass money to content creators.\n\nAnd it's not just oil industry propaganda. They're a large force behind the current right wing push globally. For example, oil industry lobbying groups are sending money through intermediaries to Environmental Progress, who in turn is spending that money lobbying Californians about how terrible drug use is, because that has shown to be a popular issue with center-left Americans. They then use these topics to drive favourability for right wing governments, who in turn will stop efforts to reduce driving in cities - maintaining demand.\n\nSame reason why 15 minute cities became a big conspiracy thing. It was literally just the same people trying to prevent the implementation of city structures that would reduce oil consumption.\n\nEdit: In Canada, we could literally meet all of our environmental goals JUST by shutting down an three companies operations. Three companies. And who owns those three companies? Americans. We are having a political war between several provinces and the feds over the fact that those three American owned companies are threatened, and so they're fighting back trying to overthrow the feds. \n\nIt's nuts."

Inevitably, the staff are going to rebel, and that's the least of the problems.

Just for this its in most countries\u2019 interests to chase energy efficiency. \n\nThe last time Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement, other countries stayed true. With their advancements and with renewable energy having economic incentive, US continues to lose its power and will be left behind. \n\nEventually, even if the US was not compliant, the other countries with the majority will be able to slap taxes on us. Europe also has laws on imports to meet requirements for methane, so if we dont conform, we will only lock ourselves out of trade opportunities.\n\nThe US already has 10 million jobs in renewable energy compared to only 300k in fossil fuels. Even if Trump opposed green energy, there is naturally more economic opportunity there so regardless the market is going to go there.\n\nhttps://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-trumps-re-election-and-impact-on-climate-issues",

So if the US fails to reduce emissions, that is a lot of slack that needs to be picked up by the rest of the world, especially given that most countries are already struggling to meet their current targets.\n\nThe second is that the US is hugely influential economically, politically, and militarily. While this influence may erode over time, it's not going to change much in the short term. Reducing emissions is a complex problem requiring coordination among many competing interests. There is a cost to reduce carbon intensity, and the incentives start to break down if not everyone shares the burden."

The worst we can do, based on our best evidence from prior warming events, is 10\u00b0C which is called equilibrium warming. So if we stop emissions today, or at least stop emitting more than is sequestered, it won't get any hotter than 3\u00b0C over pre-industrial. This is still going to destroy our civilization as 2\u00b0C is already pretty bad, but it won't extinct life as we know it. But the key takeaway is that we need to stop pumping so much pollution into the air so it stops getting worse.\n\nWe need to stop consumerism, increase housing density, rebuild our infrastructure to adapt to a world 3\u00b0C hotter, and let nature re-wild in the areas we surrender. We need managed de-growth. Seems like it won't be very well managed tho"

                "Content": "Well\u2026 not to rain on the parade, but this only happens if there are no feedback loops and the ocean carbon-sink remains as effective as it is right now.\n\nAs the ocean warms, the water loses vertical convection because the warm water at the surface (the water that absorbed the heat) doesn\u2019t cool off enough to sink below the ocean. Not to mention, as the ocean sinks carbon, it acidifies. We don\u2019t know how a more acidic ocean will affect the climate, but we do know it will make it increasingly difficult for animals with calcium carbonate shells to maintain their shells. This will cause systemic marine ecological collapse. The added freshwater from melting glaciers will add variables we cannot know to the equation.\n\nThe feedback loops resulting from such a quick change in the temperature (quick on the scale of deep time) will be catastrophic. Think of a mobile (the dangly spinny thing). If you flick the mobile, it teeters back and forth until it regains balance. The feedback loops will do that but it won\u2019t regain balance. \n\nSo\u2026 hopefully this is true but the real truth is that we have no idea what will actually happen.\n\nThat is, if we stop emitting carbon at all\u2026 which won\u2019t happen until our society collapses to begin with."

                "Content": ">About 10 years ago, this was formalized in a nice way by Ricke and Caldeira, who showed that the maximum heating from a slug of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere occurred about a decade after you emit it. After that, enough of the slug has been removed from the atmosphere that the heating from the slug starts to decline (but the fall off is slow and it continues to heat the climate for a very long time).     \n          \n>The sooner we can get emissions to (net) zero, the sooner we stabilize our climate system. And, as I said in [this post](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/the-doom-spiral \"https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/the-doom-spiral\"), we have the technology to largely do that today. Whether we do so or not is a political decision, not a technical or scientific decision.   \n       \n>In our actual climate system, these two processes happen at roughly comparable rates. The cooling effect of declining CO2 levels tends to offset the warming caused by heat transfer into the deep ocean. This balance means that, after emissions stop, global temperatures are expected to remain relatively stable instead of significantly rising or falling."

People live in places like Borneo and tropical/desert climates who are facing a situation where their traditional cooling mechanisms such as shade are becoming less effective. \n\nFor many - think roofers in the summer and other summer workers - this is not even a choice and about livelihood.\n\nFlorida itself is unlivable without AC.\n\nYes, many people saved excitedly their whole lives and were sent off happily by communities and relatives to experience their version of a religious experience with the understanding that they might not come back (for the old). It was still the highlight of many of their lives and yes, the experience should be made more livable but Saudi is making progress there (albeit slowly). The reason many of them are old is because they have spent their lives working off worldly commitments and they happily and proudly take on the risk of not coming back for a shared experience.\n\n  \nThese are human stories about global climate change and we should be taking the lessons from this rather than using it as an excuse to make cheap, smug anti-religion points."

        "Created": "2024-11-14 21:10:38",
        "Content": "**My Background:** I live in the lovely northern state of Minnesota which right now is experiencing a drought all across the state from abnormal to severe conditions. The only people that seem to pay attention to things like this are people like myself who have a small family run farming operation in Wisconsin, also experiencing the same drought conditions. My mom who does the work on the farm tells me that \"you cannot educate the people who do not want to know\" and I think that this may be partly true but I also have a hypothesis that we have become so disconnected from nature that we do not appreciate it and we certainly have lost all respect for it. I come from a background of spending most of my life outside, where if I pulled a branch off of a living tree I had to apologize to it, where I had to learn about what bugs where invasive and which ones weren't and how to ride horse and why animals need to be respected or they won't respect you. \n\n**Why I Believe People are Disconnected:** What sparked this entire rant today was a single comment I made at work, \"I am hoping we are getting some snow soon.\" You would think for a state notorious for blizzard conditions and long snow seasons that this would not be controversial but I was dog-piled by my group for even the mere mention of snow. \"Dont wish for snow!\" \"I want a winter just like the last one!\" (We got very little snow last year which is why we have been in a drought almost all year long!) This infuriates me beyond belief because I know these people believe in climate change and the first angry thoughts in my head are \"then why in the hell do you life here?\" I know I cannot confront people in this way so that is why I need to think about why are people so disconnected from the health of the earth? \n\nThe vast majority of people now live in homes with central a/c and heating, soundproof windows, and warm insulation, which yes we need these things but what do they do? Our exposure to the elements has been cut off, it has been made optional. Listening to the birds, the wind, or just the sounds of the day have become something we choose not to do (or in my case I can't hardly stand having my window open where I live due to all the man made noise). In places like Minnesota and Wisconsin where I have lived my whole life people choose to not leave their homes when it's winter, which before climate change really started to show its true face would last a good 6 months and now its about 3-4, and would instead opt to stay inside, something that has become more and more of a trend as technology has become more prevalent in our lives. We no longer have community anymore, people do not go out and attend the big cross-country skiing events of yesteryear, do snowshoeing, ice skating, etc. I noticed this to be especially true in the larger city and suburban areas of Minnesota where people do not engage with one another, its really quite depressing. In becoming an urban people we have become so fragmented from the very ground that we walk on.\n\n  \n**I am Seeking Advice:** I come here seeking some guidance or ways to handle these frustrations, how can I approach people acting this way? It is easy for me to get upset that people do not understand that there is a drought, that wanting no snow will surely lead to no food/water, or wildfires. If I say these things to people then I become the \"bad guy\" because I am not only \"wishing for snow\" but I am actively bringing down everyone's mood by just simply telling them the hard truth that the world has not equipped them to hear. However I am really trying to engage all of those around me that I can because these topics are important and continuing to be ignorant to such things will only do themselves and others harm. \n\n  \n***TLDR:*** people in MN/WI think having winters with no snow is good because they are so disconnected from nature they don't understand droughts. I believe people are disconnected from nature because of our urbanized/suburban/tech focused world where people never go outside and learn to respect the earth. I am looking for advice on how to approach these tough topics with people who come from these backgrounds that are so much different than my own so I can stop getting so frustrated but also hopefully get a good message across.",

It has really really really made it hard for me to keep up hope but I am trying to remember that I am privileged in having the family land and that I need to continue to keep it as sustainable as possible. My cattle rotate on 40 acres of pasture and we are *already* giving them hay, its too early, they should still have fresh and green grass to eat that is watery. But the grass they have been eating is so low to the ground and dusty they are parched, they drink so much water each day. My poor cows, they are suffering too. It hurts my heart to see my animals who have no control over any of this be put under the blade too and a dry winter will make them suffer even more next summer, no doubt."

                "Content": "I've also been trying to figure out how people can possibly be unfamiliar with climate change basics, when it has been in the news for decades as an existential threat. And for most of that time, it was described as technically preventable. In addition to the separation from nature that you discussed, I've thought about more possible reasons:\n\n1. People are low in scientific literacy, so they ignore all science-y topics because they find them intimidating. These are the people who complain to their friends in front of their middle school kids about having to help the kids with their science fair poster. Low scientific literacy encourages low trust in scientists.\n2. People don't feel responsible for anything beyond their own household and close circle of people. Civic duty is a much weaker force than we pretend it is.\n3. Many people were raised in a time or culture where nature was to be tamed, not accommodated.  I'm thinking of people in my neighborhood who complain that any naturalized parts of a lawn will breed ticks, mosquitos, and the mother of all horrors, snakes. The ecological benefits are never mentioned.\n4. People are mainly emotional and secondarily rational, and the emotions surrounding climate change are such a buzz kill that people are repelled by it.\n5. People base their identity on belonging to certain groups, which often tell them to downplay climate change. Belonging is a high priority; truth is just a tool selectively used for personal gain, not a governing principle.\n6. People have low media literacy. They struggle to just google stuff about climate change, despite all the resources available. They can't separate conflicting info into credible vs. not credible, they can't curate a pile of info into a coherent perspective, and they tend to latch on to single-item explanations of complicated issues (hence the success of the 'this one weird trick' approach in clickbait).\n7. People aren't actually willing to give up much of anything for future generations or strangers. The possibility that they might be happier and more secure if we took drastic climate action is automatically discounted. If success isn't guaranteed or if some countries don't contribute, they will not support strong actions.\n\nThe majority of people I know, love, and respect fall into at least one of these categories."

Maybe cutting down and using trees is not so environmentally friendly even though wood is a renewable resource and mass timber construction of tall buildings should not be considered green building.  \n\nIt's why I favor the expanded use of infinitely recyclable steel for more uses.  One is how completely feasible it is to build houses with steel framing.  Thicker gauges of sheet metal can be bent into beams that are stronger and more durable than the soft woods that are used today.  Just like wood they will last for centuries as long as they're kept dry.  They also need to be protected from airborne salts if they're near saltwater but that is taken care of by encasing them in things like drywall, roofs, siding, etc.  They also don't have the problem that wood framed buildings have of their wood and steel fasteners expanding and contracting at different rates with changing temperatures. \n\nedit. There is no realistic risk of running out of iron.  It is about 5.5% of Earth's crust. \n\nI also favor the use of more ceramics for numerous uses and related materials like expanded rockwool for insulation.

But now that even [the IEA is forecasting peak oil demand before 2030](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/oil-demand-growing-at-a-slower-pace-as-post-covid-rebound-runs-its-course) we can expect emissions from fossil fuels will become insignificant, if not actually stop entirely, within 20 or 30 years as [solar pv and batteries become the cheapest sources of power](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41971-7/figures/4).

The higher CO2 emissions go, the faster nature removes CO2 from the air.\n\nThe main processes which remove CO2 from the air are\u00a0[uptake by the terrestrial biosphere (greening)](https://sealevel.info/feedbacks.html#greening), and\u00a0[uptake by the oceans](https://sealevel.info/feedbacks.html#co2absorb). As the CO2 level in the atmosphere rises, both of those removal processes accelerate. That's very important \"negative feedback,\" which tends to stabilize Earth's climate:\n\n>higher\u00a0atmospheric\u00a0CO2\u00a0level \u2192\u00a0accelerated\u00a0plant\u00a0growth \u2192\u00a0faster\u00a0removal\u00a0of\u00a0CO2\u00a0from\u00a0the air \u2192\u00a0lower\u00a0CO2\u00a0level\n\n>higher\u00a0CO2\u00a0level \u2192\u00a0faster\u00a0absorption\u00a0of\u00a0CO2\u00a0from\u00a0atmosphere\u00a0by\u00a0oceans \u2192\u00a0lower\u00a0CO2\u00a0level\n\nThis table is excerpted from AR6 (I added the annotations):\n\n[https://sealevel.info/AR6\\_WG1\\_Table\\_5.1\\_annot1\\_partial\\_carbon\\_flux\\_comparison\\_760x398.png](https://sealevel.info/AR6_WG1_Table_5.1_annot1_partial_carbon_flux_comparison_760x398.png)  \n(Note: their \"total emissions\" included guesstimates of \"land use change emissions,\" which are very rough.)\n\nThe IPCC compares decade-by-decade, but it can also be done year-by-year.\n\n\u2160. Since 1958 we have excellent, precise measurements of atmospheric CO2 levels, from which the year-over-year incremental changes in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere can be obtained by comparing each year's CO2 level with the previous year's level. Averaged over the years 2013-2022 it's just over +2.4 ppmv/year.\n\n\u2161. We also have good economic data for production and use of coal, oil, and natural gas, and also for cement manufacturing, from which we can calculate fossil CO2 emissions. (We also have rough estimates for CO2 emissions from \"land use changes,\" such as clearing forests and draining swamps, but I don't really trust those estimates.) Averaged over the years 2013-2022 it's 4.6 ppmv/year of fossil CO2 emissions, plus (very roughly) 0.6 ppmv/year of \"land-use change emissions.\"\n\n\u2162. By subtracting (\u2160) from (\u2161) we can calculate the removal rate, which is the net amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere each year by natural sinks (mostly the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere).\n\nIf we consider \"land-use change emissions\" to be a diminishment of natural CO2 removals, then we needn't include them in our calculation. Then for the 2013-2022 ten year averages, the difference (i.e., the removal rate) is about 4.6 - 2.4 = 2.2 ppmv/year. The advantage of this approach is that the imprecision of \"land-use change emission\" estimates does not reduce the precision of our result.\n\n(Alternatively, we could consider land-use change emissions to be part of anthropogenic emissions. In that case, the difference is about 5.2 - 2.4 = 2.8 ppmv/year. That approach is more conventional, but less precise, because of the great uncertainty w/r/t land-use change emissions. IMO, that uncertainty makes it less suitable for this sort of analysis.)\n\n\u2163. If you repeat those calculations for the entire period for which we have good data, 1958 to present, you can then plot the removal rate vs. the atmospheric CO2 level, and you'll see that the relation is approximately linear, with an x-intercept somewhere below 300 ppmv.\n\nWhen I did this exercise, ignoring ENSO effects, I found an x-intercept of 285 ppmv, and a slope of about 0.0183, meaning that each year 1.83% of the \u201cexcess\u201d CO2 above the 285 ppmv equilibrium level is removed by natural sinks.\u00a0 Here's my spreadsheet & graph:\n\n[https://sealevel.info/Global\\_Carbon\\_Budget\\_2023v1.1\\_with\\_removal\\_rate.xlsx](https://sealevel.info/Global_Carbon_Budget_2023v1.1_with_removal_rate.xlsx)\n\n[https://sealevel.info/Global\\_Carbon\\_Budget\\_2023v1.1\\_with\\_removal\\_rate\\_plot1.png](https://sealevel.info/Global_Carbon_Budget_2023v1.1_with_removal_rate_plot1.png)  \n(Note: the Y axis is in GtC (PgC). To convert to ppmv of CO2 divide by 2.1294 PgC/ppmv.)\n\nDr. Roy\u00a0Spencer\u00a0did a more refined analysis, taking into account ENSO, and he found similar results. He reported an x-intercept of 294 ppmv, and a slope of 2.02%. That means the \"adjustment time\" (effective lifetime) of CO2 added to the air is about fifty years. Here's his paper:\n\nSpencer, R. W. (2023). ENSO Impact on the Declining CO2 Sink Rate.\u00a0*J Mari Scie Res Ocean*,\u00a0**6**(4), 163-170.\u00a0[doi:10.33140/jmsro.06.04.03](https://doi.org/10.33140/jmsro.06.04.03)\n\nA 2% slope means that for each 50 ppmv increase in atmospheric CO2 level, the net natural CO2 removal rate (by biosphere & ocean) accelerates by 1 ppmv/year.\n\nThat has important ramifications:\n\n1. It means that the effective average atmospheric lifetime of currently emitted CO2 is about fifty years.\n2. Since the CO2 level is currently rising by about 2.5 ppmv/year, that means if our CO2 emissions were to continue indefinitely at the current rate, then the CO2 level would increase by 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050 = only about 125 ppmv above the current level.\n3. So \"net zero\" is not necessary to stabilize atmospheric CO2 levels.\n4. In fact, if human CO2 emissions from fossil fuels ceased, the atmospheric CO2 level would plummet (with very bad [consequences for agriculture](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29320)), initially at a rate of about (422-294)\u00d72.02% = 2.6 ppmv/year."

The oceans are CO2 sinks in the cold polar regions, and sources in the tropics, so they're continually moving CO2 from the surface into the depths.\n\nAdditionally, biological processes (\"marine snow\") continually remove carbon from the surface waters and transfer it into the depths, and those processes accelerate as CO2 levels rise; here's an article:  \n[https://hub.jhu.edu/2015/11/26/rapid-plankton-growth-could-signal-climate-change/](https://hub.jhu.edu/2015/11/26/rapid-plankton-growth-could-signal-climate-change/)\n\nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) has density about 2.6 times that of seawater, so when coccolithophores die their exoskeletons sink. Along with other biological processes (the \u201c[biological carbon pump](https://rapid.ac.uk/abc/bg/bcp.php)\u201d),\u00a0this moves carbon (and calcium) from surface waters to the ocean depths (and seabed), and it does so\u00a0[much more rapidly](https://news.agu.org/press-release/radioactive-carbon-from-nuclear-bomb-tests-found-in-deep-ocean-trenches/#:~:text=Although,faster)\u00a0than\u00a0[thermohaline circulation](https://sealevel.info/glossary.html#moc)\u00a0does.\n\nOnly if CO2 levels were to drop very low would the oceans become net CO2 sources, and if that happens mankind will certainly be glad of it.\n\nIf atmospheric CO2 levels were to stabilize, CO2 uptake from terrestrial greening would eventually taper off, but not to zero, and it would take a long time.\n\nIf CO2 levels were falling, desert retreat would slow, and eventually reverse, and the current greening trend would become browning. That would, indeed, release sequestered CO2, but, again, if that happens mankind will certainly be glad of it.\n\nDespite all mankind's CO2 emissions, the CO2 level in the atmosphere would have to drop to below 300 ppmv before it was in equilibrium with other carbon reservoirs."

What that means is that our methane emissions are actually much higher than one might think from the graphic at the start of section 2, because maintaining a constant level of methane in the atmosphere requires a constant baseline of methane emissions, and every time we raise the level of methane in the atmosphere we have to emit even more to keep replacing the methane that is constantly being removed. So in order to produce a steady, sustained climb like we see currently, our actual raw methane emissions have to be enormous.\n\n>One ton of methane creates about 86 times as much warming as CO2 over a 20-year period (abbreviatedGWP20 for 20-year global warming potential). That impact goes down over time, with GWP100 at about 32x CO2. Because human civilization is not likely to last thru the next 20 years, I will use the GWP20 as the relevant value. You may note that methane concentrations are measured in ppb, rather than ppm like CO2, meaning there\u2019s much less methane in the atmosphere than CO2. However, we\u2019ve already more than doubled this potent greenhouse gas from preindustrial. A recent study suggests that air pollution (NOx) helps knock methane out of the atmosphere, so decreasing pollution could increase methane\u2019s lifespan and thus increase its GWP even higher.\n\n>Another major difference is the emissions sources. Methane comes primarily from wetlands, and one of the biggest concerns for future emissions increases is thawing of arctic ice and permafrost, which currently contain enormous amounts of frozen methane (1) (2) (3) Measurements of fossil fuel methane emissions are also highly suspect with significant underreporting.

It has been estimated that fossil fuel air pollution is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally (pre covid). Sulfates and other pollutants also cause acid rain. At the same time, those suspended air pollution particles (aerosols) make cloud tops brighter, creating a reflective shield in the atmosphere that bounces incoming solar radiation back out into space. This shielding effect protects us from as much as half of global warming. 15\n\n>Hansen refers to this as our Faustian Bargain, because we\u2019ve essentially sold out our future for short term gains. The critical point to identify here is that unlike greenhouse gases, aerosols do not persist in the atmosphere. As soon as we stop creating air pollution the normal cycles of cloud formation and precipitation will wash the aerosols out of the atmosphere within months. \n\n>Eventually, modern civilization is going to collapse. When that happens, the aerosol masking effect will end immediately, and an already catastrophic situation will become orders of magnitude worse within a single year. The danger of this cannot be overstated. As soon as economic activity collapses, global warming will increase by as much as a full 1.0\u00b0C.\n\nThat last part. In 2016 we started cutting global SOx pollution on maritime shipping. In 2020 that went into effect. The IPCC estimated a .06c increase, what we got was a .6c - 8c increase in global average temperature. And it's here to stay.

                "Content": ">One of the keystones of IPCC projections is the notion that as soon as we stop emitting CO2 then earth will stop warming. Zeke Hausfather is an IPCC author and one of the primary proponents of this position and can often be found on twitter arguing over this very topic. This is a recently developed position supported by one 2008 paper which relies on a bit of slight-of-hand in order to bend a half-truth into a foundation of the entire IPCC narrative. The half-truth is that if Net Zero is achieved, the oceans and land will indeed absorb some CO2 from the atmosphere, slightly decreasing the cumulative GHG load. The first falsehood is the proposition that this will offset the many positive feedbacks in play. Natural sinks would have to offset not just CO2 but also methane and other GHGs. The second, and much larger, falsehood is that Net Zero is simply not possible, as detailed in section 4.3.4. Not in even the remotest way. But it is the only scenario that allows IPCC to write a report that still has living humans at the end of this century. \n\n>Even Hausfather is forced to reveal the game towards the end of his article linked above: \u201cThe studies featured in this piece all look at the effects of zero-emissions scenarios today or in the next few decades.If, however, zero emissions were to occur later in the century, there is the potential to lock in more carbon-cycle feedback processes \u2013 such as melting permafrost \u2013 than under current global temperature levels. A world that has warmed by 3C or 4C above pre-industrial levels may lock in more committed future warming than today\u2019s world \u2013 and more research is needed to explore these effects.\u201d\n\n>The implication here is that even the official fantasy of Net Zero has fine print indicating a \u201credeem by\u201d date that, once passed, the terms and conditions change. If you remove the assumption of zero committed warming then all of IPCC\u2019s scenarios and pathways are invalid. Every scientist adopting the language of Net Zero is implicitly endorsing this position. I\u2019ve devoted section 5.1 to expounding this problem."

                "Content": "There is no magic number. That value is a projection based on the models. It is not like driving off of a cliff either. The greater the warming, the greater the difficulty in reversing the process. If 1.5 degrees is the tipping point, it does not mean everything is lost at 1.6 and everything is fine at 1.4. \n\nThese thresholds are doing us a disservice. It implies that there is more time that we probably have. The sooner and the more effective the intervention, the better the likelihood of a good response and reduction in harm. The longer we delay acting and the poorer the effectiveness of our interventions, the longer it will take to bring our climate back to 'normal' and the greater the harm, both short and long term. \n\nThe thresholds imply that global warming is something that isn't that bad now, and it only becomes really bad when we hit that threshold. That is far from the truth. One can see the finge prints if GW all around us. All you have to do is look. Here in Colorado the pine  beetle kill has become a problem every year and looks to continue to be a growing problem for the foreseeable future. The warming we have experienced to date has allowed the pine beetles to survive the winter in greater and greater numbers. The larva are devouring our pine trees, weakening them. Our hiking trails are littered with fallen pine trees. \n\nColorado has lost several glaciers to GW. Other areas have thier own issues. Insect pests are moving north and bringing things like Dengue fever with them. Fishing grounds are shifting, reefs are losing mass, storms are becoming stronger as the pick up energy from warmer surface waters, some area are lexperiencing drought and fires, others are wetter than normal. The list of major and minor GW effects is looooong. \n\nAll of these trends will get worse, and we will see additional effects as temps continue to rise. \n\nThe models demonstrate that modest changes right now are as effective as more herculean interventions 29 years from now. There is no such thing as too little to worry about. Today is better than tomorrow. Tomorrow is better than next week. \n\nThe crisis is here, now. It is not looming. What is looming is the degree of harm we are likely to suffer further along in the crisis."

What\u2019s really astounding is that despite everything that number hasn\u2019t moved in 8 years.\n\nAcknowledging climate change doesn\u2019t translate into lower emissions apparently, so maybe we should try to find ways to encourage it more effectively, such as with economic transformation, more efficient homes (a big one), more efficient batteries and lower carbon sources for existing fuels. All of those things are what is happening right now.\n\n85%\u00a0of new electricity generation capacity built in 2023 came from renewable sources, meaning the vast majority of new power plants are currently renewable energy sources like solar and wind. And that\u2019s not happening because people are more aware of climate change: it\u2019s happening because it\u2019s cheaper and more efficient to deliver power from these sources.\n\nLet\u2019s lean into that. While politicians talk about climate, fund fat handouts under the \u201cgreen flag,\u201d and talk about the need for awareness, we are actually seeing consistent annual reductions, and it\u2019s not coming from government programs. It\u2019s coming from the industries themselves. Not awareness. \u00a0Not government spending bills.\n\nOur best bet to *actually* have a better climate outcome from a practical sense is to start moving away from fossil fuels. The way to do that is to make the use of fossil fuels economically unsustainable, and that *is what is happening*.\n\nThe largest contributors to current CO\u2082 concentrations are\u00a0China (30 percent) and the United States (nearly 14 percent). \u00a0After that it\u2019s India, Russia and Japan. The idea that this group is going to cooperate right now on lowering global greenhouse gas levels is asinine. Just look at that list. They\u2019re almost all already in a proxy war together \u2014 the only way we will see actual change away from fossil fuels is when the cost of using them is much more than sustainable storage and generation. This idea that everyone is going to cooperate together and hammer their economies and endanger their position as leaders of these countries is unlikely at this point.\n\nWe need to update our ideas to the realities of 2024. If we are going to head off the world of climate change, it\u2019s going to have to happen not through toothless International agreements, but economics."

In May 2022, as females readied to lay eggs, birds began dying in droves. \u201cThousands started washing on our shores.\"\n\nThe culprit: a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, that had recently arrived in North America. Over the months that followed, the virus raced through the region, killing tens of thousands of northern gannets. The carnage was \u201cdevastating,\u201d Dr. Avery-Gomm said. \u201cYou have to harden your heart to work on this scale of mortality.\u201d\n\nBut for the world\u2019s wild birds, the prospect of a deadly, uncontained outbreak is not theoretical. The virus has already decimated avian populations globally, with body counts that can be staggering: an estimated 24,000 Cape cormorants killed in South Africa, 57,000+ pelicans reported dead in Peru.\n\n\u201cThe mortality scale is truly unprecedented. There\u2019s nothing comparable historically.\u201d Wild birds are poorly monitored, & the true global toll and long-term consequences unknown. But it's clear the virus is an unwelcome new climate change danger including habitat loss, overfishing & human activities\n\nSince Oct 2021, 117,000+ dead wild birds \u2014 from 315 species in 79 countries \u2014 have been reported to World Organization for Animal Health.

It's roughly comparable to other cities at similar altitude. The point of the study was to review the changes in genetic profile between geographically isolated populations. The fact that the isolation just happened to be due to closure of the CEZ is a red herring."

Sixty percent of road transport emissions come from passenger travel (cars, motorcycles, and buses), and the remaining forty percent is from road freight (lorries and trucks).

Those big massive volumetric machines that cause blindspots, endanger other drivers as the seat is a foot or two higher and encorages aggressive driving, especially when Big Auto selling the high margin cars replaced bench seats with buckets seats, rendering the driver a Star Trek style command view, ironically oblivious to the micro balloon tire pollutants and hydrocarbon, nitrous oxide and thermal waste coming out, a debt blindly levied to future generations. The yahoo rolling coal becomes the epitome of technology rendering the human condition in all its unexamined state.\n\nThis is but one symptom of the multi-polar crisis as Schmachtenberger describes, and is a chain of cause and effect. Global heating happens to be the more salient of many breached tipping points in earth's system. It is a dire predicament leading to, arguably, an extinction-level outcome. No quantity of Priuses, Teslas or PV panels will get us out of this pickle. There is no clear path forward and clearly our political system is inadequate to address the poly-crisis, considering a leading candidate is a convicted felon, rapist, tax cheat, liar, and who has less respect for the Constitution than an uneducated immigrant worker honestly working at McDonald's. \n\nI empathize with the young people who realize all of this and go home in deep despair since it is game over."

                "Content": "I think there is a lot of good progress being made, the problem is that it\u2019s still not fast enough.\n\nThe world just installed more solar than ever before and cost of solar is now so ridiculously low that it seems like renewables are gradually becoming cheaper for electricity generation than fossil fuel based generation, even accounting for storage. Li ion battery production has scaled up so much over the past 5 years that prices have dropped enormously, which is good both for EV adoption and grid-scale energy storage.\n\nOn the industry front, companies are starting to have a better understanding of their true carbon footprint and how to reduce it, much more so than even just 2 years ago. Yes, many companies will miss their 2030 pledges - but many of the big capex decisions are being made with carbon neutrality in mind. Companies are also putting pressure on their suppliers to reduce their scope 3 emissions (a few years ago they only looked at scope 1 & 2), which has domino effects as well. So also here the direction of travel is clear, speed is the issue.\n\nOn the legislative side, initiatives like the EU\u2019s CSRD and Canada\u2019s carbon tax are helping as well by creating incentives and common methodologies.\n\nSo don\u2019t let the political setbacks & doom scrolling convince you that nothing is being done or that we\u2019re not making progress. We need to do more and we need to go faster. But we\u2019re not standing still."

Representative politics in a broken toxic system has this weird element of survivorship bias whereby the \u2018representatives\u2019 who are able to survive Washington bear no resemblance to the people they represent. If Alex Jones was right about anything, it\u2019s that calling these people lizard people isn\u2019t too far fetched from reality. I would like to have hope, but just like faith, I can\u2019t compel myself to believe that which I do not believe. My version of hope is to realize that as destructive as humans can be, we ultimately will pay the price for repeatedly soiling our own bed. Nature and the pIanet will survive just as it survived asteroid impacts and huge climactic swings in the past. I feel remorse for the future generations that will have to inherit a much more challenging environment, but I would drive myself crazy if I didn\u2019t find some level of acceptance as to our species ineptitude to address a problem that in reality is a lot more simple than putting a man on the moon. It\u2019s the emotions of fear and greed and other base level programming which is ultimately holding us back and I\u2019ve come to realize we are slightly more sophisticated apes in clothing\u2026and I\u2019m okay with this\u2026.because my own mental sanity demands it. These discussions anyways start to go down the meta philosophical rabbit hole quickly though because so much of what we get worked up about are only \u2018problems\u2019 because we define them as such. The reality is that our \u2018reality\u2019 on this planet as a sentient species is extremely strange and our death or survival ultimately is of little consequence because\u2026well\u2026I\u2019ll stop there lest this discussion start getting really far out there! lol"

For example, many people told me they voted for Trump because they didn\u2019t like how Kamala \u201cprioritized transgender issues while neglecting working people.\u201d When I reminded them that Harris didn\u2019t run on trans issues, and in fact avoided the topic entirely, they continued to believe whatever bullshit right-wing media had fed them.\n\nHow do we deal with this?\n\nI\u2019m concerned about the consequences for climate change because, although the scientific consensus is very clear on this subject\u2014and although the average person has actually begun to *feel* the effects of climate change where they live\u2014people have shown that they\u2019re willing to completely disregard reality in favor of what the TV says.

I flip to CNN and it's a live interview with the Governor of Georgia and he mentions how he talked to President Biden a couple times that day getting offers of whatever help was needed. Fox and other right wing propaganda outlets kept the \"no help\" storyline going to the point where governors of affected states came out and asked for the lies to stop as they were getting much help from the federal government. I have no suggestions to offer as to what to do about it it's just the reality of life in the US now and a reflection of the mindset of a large contingent of the populace. Bigly sad."

Years and years of media fighting tooth and nail to push a conservative agenda, and years and years of foreign policies pushing that same agenda, combined with even more hate and division?\n\nHow do you compete when half of what the other side believes is just simply factually incorrect?  Trump voters voted based on lies.  That's a fact, pure and simple.  They've been fed a firehose of hate, lies, and misinformation for years, and now they believe it and vote based on it.\n\nHow do you compete with that?

What they want to determine using statistics is when the rate changes; as in, the change changing faster, or the change changing slower. Although the trend is warming, there is a lot of noise, random accelerations and braking, so they claim  it is statistically difficult to pinpoint when the changing change changes. \nLike if we were driving in a car piloted by a toddler (or demon?) randomly pressing the acceleration and brake pedals - we would jerk forward and back but when can we tell if our speed is overall faster or slower.\nSo if we implement whatever passive or active geoengineering solutions it may be hard to immediately tell if it is having any effect until a longer term measurement is made. Trying to control a system this way is difficult, like when you get a lot of steering lag in a driving video game."

I'm sciencey and normally have zero trouble understanding things like this but I am missing something here.\n\nEdit: \n\nI re-read it a bunch of times and I get it now. \n\nThis is not about whether the Earth is warming. It is accepted fact that it is. However, recent record breaking temperatures have led to discussions about whether it is warning up FASTER than it was before. Is it accelerating? \n\nThe authors conclude that there's no way to actually know yet. They do mathy things to show that due to normal weather events like La Ni\u00f1a and stuff that can mask global long term trends, it can be hard to detect things positively in the short term.\n\nDepending on how you do the math, there may or may not be acceleration, and there is no way to get a definitive answer. \n\nThey point to an apparent slow down in the 1990s that led people to hope that we were improving and beating climate change. \n\nThey argue that this \"slowdown\" was actually just a result of normal weather events causing s cooling trend that covered the overall warming trend, and now the Earth is kind of catching up. \n\nSo the surface temperature has just done a big jump, but it's a result of warming that has been going on steadily since the 70s, and we're just catching up. \n\nBasically, they say that the global mean temperature is really sluggish in responding to atmospheric CO2 because climate is complicated. It's like we are at the end of a line of dominos and some results don't reach us until way later. \n\nThis recent jump is the result of a domino falling. It was actually put in motion a long time ago. Maybe more dominos are being knocked over today than in 1980, but we won't see conclusive proof right away. \n\nSo they conclude that we just can't know for sure whether it is accelerating or whether it has been steadily increasing and just LOOKS like it slows down or speeds up. \n\nIf it IS accelerating (because we know the amount of CO2 we dump in the atmosphere nas increased) then we won't see statistically significant evidence of that for a while."

                "Content": "To be clear, you need to understand what the methodology they used actually does. Change detection using statistical methods is looking for a shift in the shape of a distribution usually by evaluating how catastrophically different a mean is at every single data point. Usually by seeking to find a shift in the mean ahead of you and behind you that is outside the 95% confidence interval. \n\nThis sort of analysis is good for what is known as catastrophic shift, but is actually not so good for chaotic shifts where the data is already itself, averaged.\n\nFor example if they used it in a temperature anomaly graph, they will never be able to find the point of a shift column because the anomalies themselves are already part of the means they choose. That would be a bad application of statistics.\n\nAnother situation is when the system is chaotic but not catastrophic. Usually eventually the catastrophe comes from the chaos when it moves from a point of stable equilibrium into either unstable equilibrium or general disorder. However, you need to have enough data points after the pointer which you assess it for it to demonstrate shift. And I don't think they have enough of that yet to say for certain. Because they can't make a determination on half a handful of data points in recent years, compared to the data since 1970."

But there is also a likelyhood (estimated to be 5-10%) that its significantly higher than the mainline range as high as ~6-8C. That would also mean that we have accumulated at least ~2C of delayed warming even already.. That would be a full blown catastrophe.\n\n So any sign that the global warming is heading on ECS=6C trajectory must be taken VERY seriously. And you cannot waive that concern away with fancy statistical analysis of the last 60 years...\n\nHere is a take on a more extreme estimates for ECS values: https://richardcrim.substack.com/p/short-takes-the-evidence-accumulates"

But that\u2019s a typical climate denier thinking.\n\nTidal gauges are in places all along country\u2019s coastlines that anyone can check. Satellite data shows the same Amount of sea level rise is the tidal gauges. We have pictures and satellite images thar show land ice and glaciers melting all over the world. Rational people, see those pictures and realize the oceans must be rising. \n\nYou must be completely ignorant of the fact that 20,000 years ago the planet was 5C colder than today. So we obviously cannot be in the coldest period. Even the oil companies now accept the overwhelming evidence that the world is warming. Only flat earthers  are left that deny climate change anymore.

                "Content": "As someone who has spent their entire adult life working to change norms in the way American municipalities do things to save resources for the environment, I can tell you that technology is changing for the better.  Waste to energy programs are becoming more than just a fantasy.  Technology is starting to bail us out as some of the biggest forms of pollution are becoming a thing of the past.  I spent my entire career pushing to get new products into my industry because they use less power or save more water.  The amount of water and power this new equipment saves can be measured in hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per year in electricity and water bills.  I have worked with air quality management districts to clean up the air in California and it\u2019s gotten better.  My business was built on helping the environment while also being completely practical and saving money for the end users.  \n\nI say all this not because I want a cookie or accolades.  I don\u2019t care about that because I\u2019m someone who does things because it\u2019s the right thing to do and I don\u2019t need to virtue signal or shame my neighbor for the car they drive.  That\u2019s exactly what many climate activists do.  As someone passionate about the environment I can tell you that there are much better ways to help the environment than to be condescending and have climate protests.  \n\nI don\u2019t ever post here and didn\u2019t know this sub existed until I scrolled past.  Some advice especially for young people.  We are short good environmental engineers in this country, and there is more work in water/wastewater/air quality management/waste to energy/technology sector (making sure the new microchip factories are not destroying the environment), than we have competent people to fulfill.  Come join us in the real fight for the environment and make a real change.  It\u2019s fun and you can make great money helping the planet.  Billions upon billions are spent on these projects like full reuse of water (our technology has gotten so good that it\u2019s safe to go toilet to tap).  My advice is to stop telling other Americans what they must do (nothing makes an American more likely to do the opposite than being told they Have to do anything).  Get in game and make a real difference.  If college isn\u2019t for you water and wastewater treatment is the future and these new facilities are woefully understaffed.  Most of the time these are high paying jobs with only a couple years experience and city benefits galore.  Most of the operators retire young and then take jobs in the private sector making tons of money.  \n\nLastly, I will say we know climate change is real because we are currently planning for increasing temperatures for the ratings on the equipment we sell, but it\u2019s definitely debatable the rate in which we are capable of increasing them.  My opinion is we are going to have to technologically get ourselves out of this because other countries like China and India are not going to stop polluting until it\u2019s economically beneficial.  There is hope but we need way more passionate intelligent people joining the fight."

No warming --> warming but caused by stronger sun --> or its natural warming cycles --> fine its human caused but not that bad --> not that bad and China wont stop -->  bad but it would be more costly to do anything about it. \n\nHappy in their ignorance to avoid the dissonance that would come with actually understanding the topic and thus altering their worldview. The position will stay the same either way(inaction and ignoring it) because climate change has become almost dogmatic position that ties into peoples worldview and political identity. Often people tied to a rightwing identity will literally just choose a level of ignorance that they are comfortable with. Ive seen far lefties push inaction too with climate doomerism, pushing inaction because they believe were all doomed anyways almost dogmatically.\n\nUde have to sit them through years of science, economics, math and modelling lessons for them to have nowhere left to hide their ignorance. Otherwise they will always find some level of ignorance to hide their position of indifference. People believe what they want to believe... If you dont want to believe ur actions fuck up the climate and that has massive consiequence... ule believe that. Semi-science literate cons will hide inaction in oversimplified economic arguments that suffice for their audience(like Bjorn Lomberg) while most dumber cons are fine butchering basic climate science(Tucker Carlson, Jordan Peterson type idiots), but usually they mix multiple kinds of denial. They sure as shit arent gonna learn enough about the topic to debunk themselves."

Since I don't have access, I just thought of the Paris climate accord as one on the climate policies that were established over the last 2 decades. EDIT: The Warming limit was originally 2 degrees, but it was said to be too high which was lowered to 1.5 degrees to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. This limit was exceeded last year, but it has not been breached since it's based on Earth's average temperature over the course of decades in which it would take at least a decade above 1.5 Celsius for it to be breached."

                "Content": "OK, I'll try to summarize since it's not available otherwise. The policy analysis is complicated by multiple policies being implemented over time in different countries. The analysis was machine learning that broke things into 4 sectors (buildings, transportation, industry, and electricity) and associated major reductions in emissions with the likely policies.\n\nWhile the number of policies adopted steadily increased since 2000, most countries saw few sectors with substantial changes in emissions; especially developed countries. The US and Mexico only saw reductions in transportation; in Canada it was only in industry. In developing countries, the reductions were much greater, for example in Colombia. \n\nThey caution that the results are \"highly uncertain\" but some of the nuggets:\n\n\\- In the electricity sector, we detected two adjacent breaks for the United Kingdom in 2015 and 2016. These follow the mid-2013 introduction of a carbon price floor that imposed a minimum price for UK power producers in the EU emission trading system... our attribution method ... reveals that the carbon price floor was part of a wide policy mix that included command-and-control measures (renewable portfolio standards, renewable expansion planning, stricter air pollution standards, and the announcement of a phase-out of coal power plants) and other market-based incentives (renewable feed-in tariff and auctions).\n\n\\- In most cases, we found that effect sizes are larger if a policy instrument is part of a mix rather than implemented alone. Some policies\u2014for example, labels and fossil fuel subsidy reforms\u2014are only ever associated with large emission breaks in a mix, which suggests that these types of policy intervention are either never implemented as a stand-alone policy or do not cause major emission reductions by themselves.\n\n\\- By contrast, taxation is a notable exception in effectively causing large emission breaks alone. The effect sizes of policy mixes that combine non\u2013price-based instruments with taxation or reduced fossil fuel subsidies suggest that in most cases pricing is the complement that enables effective emission reductions.\n\nThere's more where that came from, not a lot of smoking guns."

                "Content": "Mitigation (prevention) is still necessary but the general consensus is that local municipalities should focus on adaptation (preparedness). Local communities cannot do a lot to mitigate the issue, they can be part of the solution, but not THE solution so resources are generally better spent of local adaptation measures; increasing tree canopy for carbon sequestration (mitigation) and stormwater control (adaptation), green infrastructure to handle heavy precipitation events to offset flooding damage, natural shore barriers for coastal communities and wetland restoration for all communities.\n\nAdaptation also includes community resiliency; how quickly a group can get back to normal. This involves community outreach to immigrant and refugee populations, inclusion of all people on community preparation. I really believe that no one demographic has a monopoly on solutions to these problems so it helps the entire community to include, well, the entire community.\n\nAdaptation is an academic field onto itself but it has been practiced for generations the world over. Just learn about everyone in your community, work with them, and solve local solutions with them. Because shit invariably hits the fan and more often now with climate change and you will want everyone in your community to help.\n\nThat is climate adaptation resiliency and thank you for listening to my TEDTalk."

Force sugar companies to clean up their messes and stop all corporate bottling of spring water. What to do with the failing sewage systems are a question I don't have an answer for. There's so much sewage in the waters at the beaches the state stopped reporting on it so tourists wouldn't be discouraged. I don't even have a concept of how to fix that, quite honestly. Look up the work on the Indian River Lagoon if you're interested in how bad that infrastructure is. \n\nLong term / permanent solution is to abandon the state. Wetlands, marshes, swamps, and watershed are being filled in and built on which creates a whole drainage issue for the water which can no longer reach its final destination of the ocean. Lakes like Lake Okeechobee are a festering pit of waste from big sugar which when the army corp of engineers drains it leads to massive red tide off the coasts. Piney point is a wasteland of radioactive phosphogypsum that's liner is busted and leaking into the drinking water of the Tampa Bay area and a ton more was drained off into the bay itself. And the governor has decided we will use the radioactive material mixed with asphalt to pave roads (so every time it rains drivers can be exposed to the gas off and more leaches into the ground). Theres also like 30 more of those sites around the state. New developments with their big golf courses are pumping more out of the aquifers than goes in now and nestle pumps millions of gallons out of the springs every year. This leads to the limestone crumbling and sink holes forming. They're forming all over the place. Not to mention there is now salt water intrusion into some of the aquifers leaving it unable to be used for drinking water without changing the infrastructure for treatment. Hurricanes are becoming larger, more powerful, and more destructive every year. The gulf does not cool off any more so hurricane season will end up becoming longer. The heat is becoming worse in the summer. This leads to a feedback loop of people running air conditioners more contributing more to climate change. It's to the point the old timers have given up growing any vegetables outside of things like okra as the heat just destroys them. None of this to mention sea level rise which causes cities like Miami and Tampa to flood during normal rain storms. Speaking of which, they haven't been normal storms the last few summers. Used to be able to set your watch by the storms. Now they come whenever, last longer, and are more severe. This is very surface level. People have Florida on a speed run to destruction. There's not a good way to fix all that's wrong with the state. Or at least not one a majority of people would like and support and pay for."

I'm  just a multigenerational Floridian who is super, super passionate about my state. \n\nHousing in Florida has been super expensive since covid, unfortunately. It's pushed a ton of folks whose families have been here forever out. But that's a topic for another day. As far as I am aware homes along the coast get the special foundations due to building codes but everyone else gets a standard foundation. This is why foundations inland are known for having issues and requiring repairs. That concrete just laps up all the liquid from our rains and moist soils. Which is why having an inspector do a super thorough job of checking out the foundation of a home before purchase is critical. Otherwise you may end up with a very costly repair or even with a home with a sinkhole underneath it.  It's a whole mess down here lol"

Some have even left the state completely due to it no longer being profitable.\n\nHurricanes might not be new, but 100's of millions or billions(like this year) of dollars of damages every year is not sustainable.

Public beaches are fine, but buildings and (most) roads need to be back from the coast a few miles onto higher land.\n\nReplant the coast with offshore and onshore ecosystems that were there before - mangroves, extensive shallow marshes, dunes if appropriate, etc.\n\nYou don't have to build to any particular code, but if you want to sell the property or rent it then you have to demonstrate that the building and hookups meet minimum recommended standards for the year in which it was built. Insurnace companies should be encouraged to incentivize construction to known best practices at the time the permits are approved.\n\nAs we get a better handle on how sea level rise may progress, discourage development toward the coasts and encourage it toward the central ridge. And no development from the south edge of Orlando at all, including in all the cities/towns. They need to migrate north now, not later."

Planting trees here and there, asking people to walk instead of drive... it's all lipstick on a pig. Warming and climate change will only accelerate without a massive, coordinated, global effort.\n\nI am sorry but we can't discuss climate change without necessarily discussing leadership i.e. politics. A full 80% of my faith in humanity evaporated when months ago India's government refused to do anything about climate change, saying that as a developing nation they should be allowed to follow the same trajectory of industrialism and growth as the US, China, etc. I found that to be an untenable argument as India is the 5th wealthiest nation by GDP. It's just that their wealth, like ours and everyone else's, is terribly unevenly distributed.\n\nMy last 20% of hope went down the toilet last week when the wealthiest nation, the US, elected a known ignoramus and criminal to the office of the presidency. Even now, he is filling his cabinet of leaders with blowhards and nihilists. Humanity collectively is going to blow through 1.5 deg warming."

You are calling all simulation models junk science because you don't like the prediction. And I would agree with you if the simulation models used were reading tea leaves or asking the entrails of a dove. But they don't. Current climate models integrate every known factor known to us that could impact climate, and they disagree on mathematical weighing of factors. So their accuracies are inevitably nowhere near 100%. But they are much much better than 60%, and pretty much since their first inceptions, even when Exxon ran its own climate modeling in the 1970s, and hid it from the public until a law suit forced it out in the open fourty years later (and proved to be accurate enough). Their climate model prediction then had a decent enough accuracy to make it a better predictor than anything you are contributing here. Stop obfuscating. Of course this is not Newtonian physics. Of course the model results describe statistical probabilities. To come to the mind-boggling conclusion that this then must be junk science is only an accumulation of meaningless words tinged by your personal preferences. I take most climate models predictions as more probable to be true than your unscientific rant here, which makes all of a hot-air bla of an argument."

For example your claim that species are going extinct at a rate unmatched since the astroid impact 66 million years ago. There is no doubt that we are losing species, but we don't honestly know at what rate this is comparable to other time periods. We don't even know all the species that exist on the planet today, let alone millions of years ago. This is reddit I'm not going to go into all the details but I could go on for quite some time as to why there isn't enough certainty to make broad alarmist claims like we are cooking the earth.

Here at home, Trump\u2019s plans for the environment range from heavy-handed ([massively downsizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and NASA](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/election-noaa-fema-fates-project-2025-rcna177722)) to selfish ([creating tax breaks for oil companies in exchange for campaign contributions](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-panels-launch-probe-into-trump-quid-pro-quo-with-energy-execs-2024-05-23/)) to downright bizarre ([abolishing regulations for low-flow showerheads](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2024/07/trumps-culture-war-climate-rhetoric-clean-energy/)).

Along the way, there have been many other huge steps backward\u2014some that came well before the first national park was established, or the first Earth Day was celebrated.

When we instal 3 terawatts of solar photovoltaics a couple of things happen.  During late morning and early afternoon a huge amount of electricity does not currently have a buyer.  A lot of that energy needs to go somewhere.  New industries will emerge to soak up some of the excess.  They have to be able to utilize the energy to make profits but cannot be too expensive of an investment.  They have to sit idle in evening and overnight.  \n\nOne of the effects is that power plants become poor investments because they are worthless for a large portion of the day.  Another effect is cheap electrolysis.  Fertilizers, at least nitrogen will come from solar and rarely wind.  Electrolysis will feed hydrogen into refining.  Products like petroleum coke disappear unless there is high paying demand for it.  Biomass can also feed carbon into the catalytic crackers.  Cheap electric creates cheap steel and aluminum.

All of it should be reprocessed and burned (nuclear reacted not bonfire).  \n\nContext (skip to next paragraph) The uranium in spent fuel from pressurized water reactors (most commercial in USA) still has more uranium 235 in it than natural uranium.  Natural uranium has U234 which is a slight bonus and spent fuel has u236 which is a nuisance.  Neither is a deal breaker.  PWR can also use mixed oxide fuel with plutonium.  The plutonium also taken from spent fuel rods.  If we ran completely out of enriched stocks and also shut down all uranium mining power plants would be mildly inconvenienced.  \n\nI suggest buying *nothing* from Russia and also shutting down all uranium mining.  After our 100,000 tons of spent fuel has been sent through a second cycle it will have a larger buildup of plutonium 242, uranium 236, and other actinides.  All of the actinides including all isotopes of uranium, plutonium, and thorium are fissionable in an actinide burner fast fission reactor.  \n\nAn actinide burner uses a particle accelerator.  Physics labs actually use lead as targets to create neutron sources.  Because lead is utterly non fissile and non fertile it shuts off instantly.  Actinide burners were determined to not be commercially viable because the particle accelerator draws electricity.  Drawing electricity is not a concern when you have huge surpluses of wind and solar electricity.  The newly bred plutonium 239 and uranium 232 can be blended with uranium from spent fuel rods to resupply the existing PWR reactors."

That means over $4.6 trillion per year, almost 5% of global GDP and 40% of what we spend on energy, goes up in smoke due to fossil inefficiency. Literally.\n\n>The winds are changing, though, as fossil technologies are undercut by more efficient alternatives. End-use efficiency is driving out fossil fuels, reinforced by three new tailwinds that upend the energy landscape: renewable electricity, localization, and electrification. These drivers will allow us to drastically cut down on energy waste and phase out fossil fuels."

                "Content": "In this case, that is the \u201cwasted heat\u201d from burning fossil fuels.  I had to look this up to understand it myself.\n\nOther than solar power, generating electricity at its most basic, means spinning coiled copper wire around magnets.  We do this by hooking an axle up to a turbine, and releasing pressurized steam to force the turbine to rotate, and that rotational force is transferred to the spinning coils of copper wire.\n\nIn order for the steam to steam to push the turbine, the steam must move from \u201cthe high pressure half\u201d to the \u201clow pressure half\u201d.  The steam is pushing the turbine because the laws of physics means that the high pressure zone wants to equalize with a zone of lower pressure.  \u2026 and the more you try to contain the steam on the low pressure side, it increasingly limits how much power it is transferring to the turbine\u2026 the difference between the high pressure steam chamber and the low-pressure \u201cexhaust side\u201d is what dictates how much force is applied by the escaping steam.\n\nI would love an engineer to explain to me where I\u2019m wrong (probably somewhere), because I\u2019m a straight amateur in physics.\n\nWet cooling towers use fresh water to bring down the temperature of the steam, returning it to liquid form (but not anywhere near cool) so that the near-boiling water can be recycled with a minimum of additional heat.  This means \u201cwaste heat\u201d\u2026 but it is an inherent limitation of steam-driven electricity generation, generated by any heat source.  \n\nSteam engines at large-scales (power plants) are still WAY MORE efficient usage of fossil fuels, when compared to internal combustion engines.  Internal combustion engines waste ALL the heat produced.  An internal combustion engine only utilizes the kinetic energy from the rapid combustion of a fuel-air mixture\u2026 basically a small, tightly controlled explosion  that pushes a piston many, many times per minute.  The heat energy from gasoline in internal combustion engines offers no benefit (other than the car\u2019s cabin heater in Winter)\u2026 and anyone who has had their car\u2019s radiator fail (the car\u2019s mechanism for dispersing heat) knows how the heat generated by an internal combustion engine is just an unwanted byproduct."

We already grow about 1 trillion tons of agriculture waste, the parts of the plant that we can't eat like leaves and stems, which can be converted into synthetic carbon neutral gasoline. It ironically enough shares the same problem this article points out, in that roughly half of the cellulose is burned as fuel to provide energy for the rest of the process but we only need a process with 1% efficiency to convert all the agri waste we make in a year into the amount of gasoline  we burn in a year, so we have the spare. \n\nI haven't run any numbers on the cost of this procedure, basically what cost per gallon of gas would be. But your concern about burning otherwise food edible plant matter isn't the big one holding bioenergy back."

                "Content": "It's not as straightforward as \"vote for a pro-environment candidate and the environment improves overnight\".\n\nFirst, you have to elect a climate-friendly government. We did a decent job in 2020.\n\nThen, the government needs to pass climate-friendly regulations and legislation. Biden rejoined Paris on his first day of office, his administration did enact various climate-friendly regulations, and the biggest piece of climate legislation ever--the IRA--squeaked by in 2022 with Harris as the deciding vote in a split senate.\n\nThe next step is to preserve climate-friendly policies long enough for them to make an impact. *This is where we are now, and we need Harris to win for this step. Otherwise we'll lose those policies and back to square 1.*\n\nThen, those policies lead to societal changes. Green power takes over the grid. Gas-burning furnaces are replaced by electric heat pumps. Homes become more energy efficient. Green technologies become cheaper as technology improves. Etc. As these policies take effect, CO2 emissions slow and we eventually reach net zero.\n\nUntil the moment when we reach net zero, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere continues to rise! It levels off once we do reach net zero, and (assuming our natural carbon sinks are still functioning then) then begins to gradually decline.\n\nSo in short, we will need to continue making policy progress to bring our emissions down, and we need to bring our emissions to net zero before our climate stops getting worse. This is inherently a long process so we need to be on top of it NOW and not lose the progress we've already made."

My local water would've been just fine without the need to supplement minerals.

Hydrostatic balance. Lower pressure gives us our typical rainy day weather. Dew points lower in low pressure and the air has to give up some moisture. Clouds form and it rains/snows.\n\nIf the world heats up, there should be more water vapor in the air. So even if there are less clouds, storms might have more punch. Also, when an \"Omega Block\" occurs, there can be endless days of high pressure being more or less \"stuck\" in one place for extended periods. Signifcantly less cloud cover until it breaks down and it can practically shut down the jet stream. Either sides of the block flood and the center in the \"Omega\" wilts."

Granted, I would be spending the majority of my waking hours walking. And I'd probably get run over sooner than later because there's not really many places for pedestrians to safely walk around in North American cities.\n\nOr I guess maybe I should just stop using electricity altogether because most of it is coal fire based. Maybe I should get rid of my heating and cooling. Who cares if it's minus 50 celsius outside or over 40 celsius, in a world where all the structures are designed around the assumption of there being carbon intensive heating and cooling systems. It's my responsibility to make ethical consumption choices after all!\n\nMaybe I should just stop eating altogether. Or at least stop buying clothing, shoes, and other household essentials. You know, because all of it requires carbon intensive manufacturing and logistics chains. It doesn't matter that all the products and services available to me are carbon intensive. I should just die instead of using them.\n\nHurr hurr.\n\nDude. The issue is our infrastructure is carbon dependent. Making the problem reductive to individual consumption belies the fact that there's no way to consume anything or do anything in our society without contributing substantially to emissions.\n\nIn order to fix this it will require large scale institutional action. And what we're seeing is rather than take those actions, large scale institutions such as governments and corporations are pushing the narrative that it's a matter of individual choice.

Like that's an insane ask. People use hundreds of products. Are we expecting individuals to do exhaustive research on each maker? Like they would have to dig deep into their financials to find out who they're doing business with. Climate action through conscientious/ethical consumption is a bullshit notion promoted by corporations tryng to wash their hands of responsibility for the climate crisis. It's not realistic.\n\nHence this is reductive bs.\n\nIf you want to decarbonize your economy, you need to radically change your infrastructure and industrial processes. That takes large scale, institutional action. The average individual has no control over this.

The science since 2015 has moved on and essentially says that 1.5\u00b0C is the boundary between the effects of climate change being bad and the effects being really, really bad.\n\nAlso its worth noting that in the context of the agreement, that target is by 2100, and on the understanding (though not written explicitly) that it not be exceeded.\n\nThe problem is that that the 2\u00b0C is now looking very unlikely as well.

They are engaged in propaganda that is keeping them in the dark, as I said. They were lied to and told Covid wasn\u2019t so bad. Many were so lost in the soup that even on their deathbeds, they didn\u2019t understand that Covid was going to kill them- they had ignorance. Those people are not everybody. This is a vocal third of the population at best. Its powerful and a problem, but thats the proportion we are talking about. It was also incredibly profitable for companies to have the pandemic continue. They did a massive heist on the wealth distribution in this country during those years and wearing a mask became a political statement, more than it became one on health choices. \n\nWearing a mask is a response to a danger that comes at a sacrifice. Having community infrastructure that supports abundance, health, social wellness, food security, shelter, and enrichment is not something that comes at a sacrifice- it\u2019s a horizontal and sometimes vertically upward shift. Yes it will take time and discomfort, but a lot of the pathways to those things are focused on building building good things- this is why \u201ccommunity building\u201d is the starting point people are trying to work with right now. \n\nAnd to be clear , I\u2019m not saying people won\u2019t have to sacrifice things in order to make the shift. I am saying our problem is in messaging and that we focus on the sacrificial end of it and not the gains and benefits, and wins that come from it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m speaking on. We\u2019re too reactionarily negatively brained and you\u2019re not going to get people to join movements on that kind of brain space when comfort is being offered to them. You have to offer people comfort they can\u2019t get from the place that\u2019s abusing them."

As Christmas creeps up, I\u2019m left thinking about how, in my home state of West Virginia, we\u2019ve only had two \u201csnows\u201d so far this year, neither of which stuck for more than a few hours, and how it\u2019s projected to be almost 70 degrees later this week- at the end of December. I\u2019m in my early twenties, I\u2019ve felt this trend escalating for my entire life. I can remember getting my 12th birthday off of school due to snow, in late October. It hasn\u2019t snowed here before the middle of December in years, and we\u2019ve averaged MAYBE one decent snow a year as of late. Cold, snowy weather is my absolutely favorite thing. \n\nI want to start a large family and settle down somewhere that is very, very cold and snowy, and will remain that way even as climate change takes its toll over the coming decades. Somewhere with snowpack into the spring. Does that/will that exist in the continental U.S. anymore? In 2050, will there be ANY parts of the country that get genuine blizzards? Is elevation the key? This question plagues my mind as I\u2019ve always imagined raising my kids somewhere that you can sled and play in the snow for several months out of the year, where you have to bundle up to go outside, and where Christmas is white. \n\nSo\u2026 where?

                "Content": "I live on the west side of Michigan which has historically had a lot of lake-effect snow. When I was a kid, in the '80s to '90s, snow started falling in late October to November and often snowed until early April. Snow was on the ground for much of that time. The difference between those winters and what we get now is extreme. Winter sports facilities in my area are closing permanently, ice fishing is largely a thing of the past, we sold our snowshoes a decade ago, and on and on. These are all signs that winter, as generations have known it, no longer exists. You can't go much further north than me and still be in the US. I think the continental US is slowly saying goodbye to snow.\n\nEven the UP of Michigan, which has always been known for getting many feet of snow in the winter, is warming dramatically. People used to travel to the UP in the winter for ice fishing and snowmobiling trips. Those will still happen during some winters, but it's not a guaranteed option during every winter any longer. You needed extended periods of cold to freeze lakes and make quality trails. The snow melts between big storms now, which changes everything.\n\n  \n[Climate change is erasing Michigan winters, taking our heritage with them | Bridge Michigan](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/climate-change-erasing-michigan-winters-taking-our-heritage-them)"

I think science in general has tried to  organize itself as a way to exclude human bias and corruption to the degree possible.\n\n To cite individuals or groups of scientists that have been corrupted is, as you point out, just to acknowledge scientists are human. It is the collective consensus of scientists and the willingness to eventually give up valued concepts in the face of better evidence, even if it takes time and effort to do so, that has made science uniquely effective at combatting, but never completely eliminating, bias. \n\nValuing evidence, reliance on consensus, and time are what has made science successful. Also the public perception of science is colored by the distorted way it receives scientific information.  The media emphasizes sensationalism over accuracy and confidence, often promoting stories most scientists feel are low confidence studies, or failing to report caveats the researchers state in their write-ups."

Generally speaking, I've met with nothing but resistance. \n\nThere is no acknowledgment that humans are causing climate change or that this is even the scientific consensus. Politicians and business owners in this area repeatedly cite opinions from social media that solar cycles or some other natural process is driving temperature changes. I've repeatedly heard people regurgitate conspiracy theories about relatives of politicians being on advisory councils or boards of various green energy corporations as the reason for climate change concerns. I've repeatedly heard people say that climate change will lead to longer growing seasons and be good for tourism. \n\nAll of these beliefs fly straight in the face of broad scientific consensus. The only conclusion I can reach is that most people in my area lack the capacity to recognize a scientist if they punched them in the genitalia. Either that or they secretly acknowledge the scientific facts and are actively sabotaging our planet and species for profit which would be even more depressing. I choose to be an optimist."

In other words, an ocean vortex.\n\nThis is just a blip in the long, storied life of A23a.

No differences were observed between the weekly initial and final liveweight, average daily gain, and predicted dry matter intake.\n\n> During optimal and decreasing phases, average enteric CH4 emissions were significantly reduced in steers that received Brominata supplementation compared to those without supplementation (115 vs. 185 g/d, respectively). \n\n> Additionally, both groups had similar CO2 emissions (6.8 vs. 7.2 kg/d), while H2 emissions were lower in the control group (3.4 vs. 1.8 g/d). \n\n> The findings suggest that pelleted bromoform-containing feed additive has the potential to reduce enteric CH4 emissions from grazing beef cattle."

Work from home (where possible). Would be a big help.  Move to power vehicles by renewables like wind and solar and even nuclear would also help.  So would powering our home with renewables.  \n\nAny action to curb our use of large, single occupant vehicles would be a big start though."

So by seeing it through this lens it is actually remarkable what has been accomplished by now. A lot of smaller to medium sized projects that are in most cases not really worth reporting about according to the media because the progress is incremental and the topic hard to present. Media in general is geared towards negativity because it is far more likely to get views."

If we had access to these panels then most Americans who own a house would already have solar. This is done to protect the American solar companies. For American solar cost is about 20k for a normal sized home. China panels would be about 5k so way more people would do it. The good news is that all of Europe has access to the China panels and that is actually the reason that some progress has been made on lower emissions. Put pressure on your senators and congressmen to allow the China panels. Our lives are worth more than politics and economic policy."

It would be something else if I didn\u2019t notice it getting warmer but - I do notice. It\u2019s not just a little warmer, summers are a LOT hotter than they used to be.\u00a0\n\n\nMy point is just to say, I think the average person would notice the weather trending towards getting warmer in their lifetime, and the main reason they don\u2019t is that they\u2019ve been immersed in propaganda trying to convince them what they\u2019re feeling is wrong.\u00a0"

But their studies used \u201csynthetic atmospheres\u201d.  That is to say, they have a bottle of nitrogen, bottle of oxygen, bottle of co2, and water vapor.  The air they use in the study has zero contamination in it.  Not a single microscopic particle of dirt, soot, et cetera.  That\u2019s the only way it is possible to \u201ccycle\u201d the carbon capturing material.\n\nThis technology works really great at filtering \u201cpure\u201d mediums.  But it won\u2019t hold up in real world applications where there\u2019s tons of microscopic particles hanging in the air.  \n\nThis gets posted every single day.  It\u2019s promoted as a direct air capture tech, but it\u2019s just not financially feasible.\n\nNo, they aren\u2019t close.\n\nThis has applications in industrial processes, when a mixed gaseous medium has to be separated.  It\u2019s also cutting edge chemistry tech, which is worth advancing.  \n\nThey\u2019re also making synthetic hydrocarbons via carbon capture tech (and then \u201cburning them\u201d to release CO2 in a manner where it could be sequestered, which is what they mean by \u201ccycling\u201d), which if powered with solar / nuclear would be \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d."

It is extremely energy intensive to liquefy natural gas at the export terminal and gasify it at the receiving terminal. Presumably, regular natural gas has much lower emissions than coal. Regions that produce natural gas will use it in its regular form. For example, North America uses regular natural gas. Europe used to use exclusively regular natural gas sourced from Russia but now uses liquefied natural gas."

It all depends on how leaky your infrastructure is and if you're measuring global warming potential on a 20 year time-frame or a 100. Also if you include aerosol emissions. They don't have much cooling potential over the long term but in the extremely short term they offset a good deal of warming and with uncertainty associated it could be extreme.  \n\nIf you align everything to favor gas; long GWP, low assumed leak rates of gas infrastructure, and ignore aerosols gas comes out extremely far ahead.\n\nYou align to coal and the opposite occurs, even in the USA with a gigantic gas field in the center of the country."

(We don\u2019t have nearly as many deep ocean buoys as scientists would like.  It\u2019s a bit of a blind spot.)\n\nThe oceans circulate, obviously.  In many places, surface water goes down, and in other places intermediate depth ocean water rises.\n\nAbnormally warmer surface ocean water (as a result of global warming) has long being pulled under by ocean currents.  On the other end of that current, older colder water was rising.  But on a long enough timeline the intermediate depth ocean waters are warming up.  \n\nEventually the water coming up from the deep is going to be warmer as well.  And thus has less and less of a \u201cheat sink\u201d property to it.\n\nOr more simply, as the oceans warm up, they\u2019re less able to soak up excess heat.\n\nWe have REALLY GOOD DATA on sea SURFACE temperatures, due to the overwhelming number of satellites in orbit, with just oodles of scientific instruments.  But those satellites don\u2019t see below the ocean surface.\n\nhttps://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/?dm_id=world2\n\nThere have been DRAMATIC spikes in the oceans surface temperatures.  Scientists last year were like \u201coh dear\u2026\u201d last year, as sea surface temperatures spiked hardcore.  That graph I linked above is just\u2026 wild.  In mid-March 2023 sea surface temperatures went up an unbelievable amount\u2026 so far beyond anything that can be blamed on El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nIt may be that the intermediate waters have warmed up to the point that the \u201ccold water\u201d circulating up from the depths is more of a \u201ccool water, not cold water\u201d.\n\nThis is kind of like the the last of the ice in your beach cooler melting.  The buffer against the heat is running out.\n\nI really hope that the sea surface temperatures return back down towards the expected rate of warming\u2026 rather than the massive \u201cbreaking loose\u201d that we saw happen in March 2023 (and it hasn\u2019t come back down).  I\u2019m really just repeating what people with PhDs in science are saying.  Hopefully the sea surface temps from March 2023 to now will be a blip and they will fall."

And a compact is not indelible when times change. \n\nI talked about how there is often a flood in one place and a drought in another. Also, California has spent a fortune on systems to drain rainwater into the ocean when there\u2019s a heavy rain, rather than catching more it it in storage for dry times, or to replenish the aquifer. Several states are fighting over imported Colorado River water and pumping the aquifers dry and collapsed. So they cannot refill even over a long span of decreased pumping. The water table is so far fallen in many areas of the US that when a 60 foot well goes dry, farmers and cities spend tens of thousands of dollars to drill deeper, a process that is doomed to failure in the not too distant future. \n\nCatching and transporting water may be one piece of the future solution to water needs, along with conservation measures, desalination, and even collecting water out of the air."

Been doing it since the early 1980's. Back then when the lakes froze we drove our cars on the lakes. Need a minimum of 10 inches to drive on. The past 3 years we didn't get enough ice to walk on. I've never seen anything like this in the 40+ years I've been ice fishing. In the 80's and 90's it was rare for the lakes not to freeze. The lakes used to freeze by the middle of December and stay frozen until the beginning of April.  The past decade if they freeze it's not until the middle of January and they thaw by late February."

We had a chance to change and we blew it. If you want to lessen the effects of climate change we need to stop polluting now. Change is permanently here probably for your lifetime, but every .1 degree counts.\n\nVote for people who take climate change seriously and we may limit the damage somewhat. If people don\u2019t want to limit this\u2026then we are fucked through and through.\n\nI won\u2019t tell you it\u2019s not bad or everything is ok because that would be a lie and a disservice to you."

These events include: seventeen severe storm events (tornado outbreaks, high wind, hailstorms) four tropical cyclones, one wildfire and two winter storm/cold wave events. The total cost of these 24 events exceeds $61 billion. However, this year-to-date total does not include Hurricanes Helene or Milton, which may add another $100 billion or more, to the 2024 costs total. The years 2024 and 2023 are well ahead of all other years, in terms of the frequency of U.S. billion-dollar events, as our **increasing exposure, vulnerability** and the **influence of climate change on some extremes**  amplify the impact.  \n            \n>Caution should be used in interpreting trends based on this graphic for a variety of reasons.

                "Content": ">Abstract\n>\n>Planting trees has become a popular solution for climate change mitigation, owing to the ability of trees to accumulate carbon in biomass and thereby reduce anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 enrichment. As conditions for tree growth expand with global warming, tree-planting projects have been introduced in regions of the highest northern latitudes. However, several lines of evidence suggest that high-latitude tree planting is counterproductive to climate change mitigation. In northern boreal and Arctic regions, tree planting results in net warming due to increased surface darkness (decreased albedo), which counteracts potential mitigation effects from carbon storage in areas where biomass is limited and of low resilience.\n\n>Furthermore, tree planting disturbs pools of soil carbon, which store most of the carbon in cold ecosystems, and has negative effects on native Arctic biota and livelihoods. Despite the immediate economic prospects that northern tree planting may represent, this approach does not constitute a valid climate-warming-mitigation strategy in either the Arctic or most of the boreal forest region. This has been known for decades, but as policies that incentivize tree planting are increasingly adopted across the high-latitude region, we warn against a narrow focus on biomass carbon storage.\n\n>Instead, we call for a systems-oriented consideration of climate solutions that are rooted in an understanding of the whole suite of relevant Earth system processes that affect the radiative balance. This is crucial to avoid the implementation of ineffective or even counterproductive climate-warming mitigation strategies in the Arctic and boreal regions."

                "Content": "The reason so many of these agreements need to be broad, hopefully worldwide agreements, is for two reasons.\n\n1. If not everyone agrees, you're not really solving the problem.  Having a few countries stop is better than none of course!  But... it's not all that great.  You need the world to work together, and if most of the world happily goes on polluting, the problem remains, just at a slightly lower level.\n2. It's seen (true or not) as an advantage to not join the agreement.  It takes time, effort, research, money to make changes like this.  Country A doesn't want to say \"we're going to spend 50 billion and have extra challenges for some of our industries for a while until we sort this out\" if country B says \"screw this, we're going to save every penny and use it to our advantage in international trade!!!\"\n\nSimple, random example.  Let's say one country says \"no more single use plastic, we're going to back to recyclable glass.\"  That's great of course... but now every product in that country costs more, and at least for a while, it's possibly a hit on their economy.  You've added $300 of extra costs to every consumer in your country.  You're less likely to do that if your neighbor says \"nah, we're not doing that\" so they don't have to take any economic hit."

Ultimately I think that is what will happen. It would have been nice to get everybody included but a bit too idealistic IMO.\n\nThis whole thing is essentially the progressive countries trying to get the petro-lobbied countries to get on board with, and contribute to, the transition (or at least that\u2019s what it felt like at the negotiations). The issue now is that the transition will not be as fast, effective or as equitable as it could have been.\n\nCompanies want a level playing field, you don\u2019t want to be the first company to transition to more expensive materials while your competitors outcompete you because there\u2019s still a large market for the cheaply made stuff. It would only make sense if further down the line, you\u2019ll be better off once the market has shifted. A unilateral agreement would have ensured that shift. But now it\u2019s a bit more risky.

We'll see if that is ultimately what happens. \n\nAnother perhaps interesting bit of insight: one of the things that kept being mentioned throughout is that they dont want this to be a repeat of the paris climate agreements. They kept calling the paris agreement \"a treaty in name only\" in that it was essentially useless. There was this sentiment that if the plastic treaty ended up being like that then it's not too different than not having one at all.\n\nAs much as they talked about fighting plastics at every point of the lifecycle I think the biggest battleground topic was plastic production. The blocker countries made it clear at INC-3 and onwards that they wont agree to strict controls on those. Maybe there's a compromise here but I guess none were good enough to pass."

If majority of the countries agree and proceed with reducing the plastic production, it will have a significant impact, putting a natural pressure on left-out OPEC countries who are currently not onboard.  It\u2019s not ideal but practical like 80:20 rule.  This would also bring down the cost of production for alternative products since major economies are onboard. \n\nEven though some countries will implement policies to reduce plastic production, it would still largely be voluntary; whereas I think a (partial) global agreement is a commitment to other nations and hence faster push across other countries. \n\nI\u2019m sure the negotiators have a good reason to push for unilateral agreement but that is slowing down the progress with an ambitious dream.\n\nWhy all or nothing on policy?"

What surprised me most was somebody who's claimed to have been at a similar conference got it wrong as well.\n\nThe first point though is that you're asking a question in a way that either has a laws of physics answer or a current intergouvernementale answer. The intergovernmental answer is what you get when you look at the COPs for biodiversity or climate change, the UN General Assembly and the Security Council. And that is because the United Nations is constituted to make decisions through 100% unanimous votes. Nothing else! You cannot take a majority vote only in very specific circumstances and the delegated authority that makes the conference of the parties work, must allow it. They don't allow it. So it defaults to unanimous voting. \n\nI used to work with the UN and they bring me into teams working on specific problems that require applied mathematical input.\n\nDon't ask these questions on reddit. It was just a stroke of luck that I was around to read this. Otherwise you'd have to run away with 100% wrong answers.\n\nTo answer the other optioned or. The laws of physics thing. Nobody has to agree for stop you can do it one of two ways you can either make the majority plastic producing countries use sustainable materials or you can ditch plastics for sustainable materials. But the problem is most developed economies don't actually understand the latter of the useful because they cannot identify sustainable materials. You just have to look in this sub to find many situations where people substitute plastics for even worse materials on a regular basis.\n\nAnd this actually lends itself to the second part of this problem. In terms of Plastics come up broadly nobody in the general public can tell the difference between a recycled plastic and original plastic or even a bioplastic. Countries can just continue to Outlaw plastics anyway come on but the problem then is if it doesn't improve the sustainable material production pathways coming including supply chains come up then it's likely to be very expensive there own citizens and make absolutely no difference if they are not one of the high polluting countries per capita.\n\nThe reason for the use of a Plastics treaty is because what comes with it in this case is a Plastics credit market. And as long as people can respect that the aim of the plastic credit market is to give financial incentives for doing better and funding and effective transition away from Plastics or at least a way from rubbish recycling of plastics and into new technological Solutions.\n\nI've seen some people referred to Saudi Arabia and the Arabian countries on this come up but actually some of the worst offenders are countries like the United Kingdom and the USA. People will claim in the UK that we sack is good here common one actually almost all of it is not recycle at all stop the UK has a very lackluster circularity rate for stop with less than 1% of most Plastics captured actually Becoming Part of another product. Which means the majority of plastics that are supposedly recycled are either incinerated or exported. Both of which are also wrong answers.\n\nThe fact that there's no agreement guarantees that they will not be any technological improvements or recycling that our larger scale to make a difference to the incredible amount of pollution that is present in marine and land contexts."

During the 2020-2022 drought, evaporation accounted for 61% of the drought\u2019s severity, while reduced precipitation only accounted for only 39%.   \n       \n>\u201cResearch has already shown that warmer temperatures contribute to drought, but this is, to our knowledge, the first study that actually shows that moisture loss due to demand is greater than the moisture loss due to lack of rainfall,\u201d said Rong Fu, a UCLA professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and the corresponding author of the study, which was published in the journal [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn9389 \"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn9389\").&nbsp; [not a paywall]   \n         \n>They predict that droughts will last longer, cover wider areas and become more severe as the climate warms.  \n         \n>Historically, drought in the West has been caused by lack of precipitation, while evaporative demand played a smaller role. Climate change caused primarily by burning fossil fuels has resulted in higher average temperatures that complicate this picture. Now, drought-induced by natural fluctuations in rainfall still exist, but there\u2019s more heat to suck moisture from bodies of water, plants, and soil.    \n          \n>A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor before the air mass becomes saturated, and precipitation can form. This creates a cycle in which the warmer the planet gets, the more water can evaporate from the landscape and remain stored in the atmosphere longer before it returns to earth as rain or snow. Droughts can form even if precipitation patterns remain within a normal range as higher temperatures and evaporation remove water from soils. They can last longer, cover wider areas, and be even drier with every little bit that the planet warms.   \n      \n>[U.S. Drought Monitor [map](https://research.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20210720_west_trd.png \"https://research.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20210720_west_trd.png\") of 11 states in the western U.S.]&nbsp; &nbsp;  _The U.S. Drought Monitor depicted the extent of the severe drought affecting the western U.S. on July 20, 2021. New research finds that increasing temperatures will make droughts like this more frequent._    \n           \n>\u201cEven if precipitation looks normal, we can still have drought because moisture demand has increased so much, and there simply isn\u2019t enough water to keep up with that increased demand,\u201d said Fu. \u201cThis is not something you could build bigger reservoirs or something to prevent because when the atmosphere warms, it will just suck up more moisture everywhere. The only way to prevent this is to stop temperature increase, which means we have to stop emitting greenhouse gases.\u201d"

This data showed that we were sliding down the backside of that trend into a prolonged period of lower than normal precipitation.\n\nI think at the time it was ignored as climate science was still a pariah and less developed (and accepted) and the usual hubris of 'we can control nature with all our intelligence and technology' over rode the obvious truth that it's hard to manage water that simply isn't there. \n\nSubsequent 'adaptation' to this looming threat has involved the usual denial and dependency on chemicals and genetically engineered crops - which isn't really a solution."

Carter, he claimed, \"I'll fix 'er\" since the economy was bad, due to many causes not due to Carter (Iranian Revolution raised global oil prices, Fed Chair Volcker raised interest rates to fight inflation).  I lost any respect for Reagan after that flip.\n\nSimilar for other things like oil production.  The legislature establishes laws.  Presidents have extended their authority via \"Executive Actions\", usually citing an immediate crisis.  But, the now-conservative Supreme Court has pushed for limiting that.

For example,\u00a0[according to NOAA](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/four-ways-climate-change-likely-made-hurricane-helene-worse/), a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph (161 km/h) winds will cause 10 times the damage of a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (121 km/h) winds. This includes damage not only from winds but also from storm surge, inland flooding, and tornadoes.\u00a0**Bottom line: A 10% increase in winds yields about a doubling in hurricane damage**\u00a0(Fig. 2).  \\[Boldface emphasis added.\\]\n\nResearchers determined about 45 percent of the economic damages caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton could be attributed to climate change, according to the article.\n\n>They added that the analysis \u201clikely underestimates the true cost of the hurricanes because it does not capture long-lasting economic impacts such as lost productivity and worsened health outcomes.\u201d\n\nNOTE:  According to post insights, available only to the author and moderators, this post has only an 86 percent upvote rate during the first 8 hours after posting.

                "Content": "Such a fuss because 2024 had 1 more hurricane count than average.  Mostly discusses future predictions:\n\n\"numerical modeling indicate human-caused climate change should strengthen hurricane intensities on average\"\n\nWhy do they throw in \"human-caused\"?  If sea temperature rises not due to humans, shouldn't that also lead to faster-growth of hurricanes?  Adding \"human-caused\" seems a requisite nod to the narrative by Climate Inc now.\n\nTheir Fig 2 shows no noticeable increase in surface sea temperatures in the tropics, where hurricanes form.  What region do they include in \"North Atlantic\"?  Certainly the warmth of the ocean between NYC and London couldn't affect hurricanes which hit FL or TX.\n\nNot much data to support their claim:\n\n\"Analyses of 38 hurricanes over the 2019\u20132023 hurricane seasons show that modern storms are \\~8.3\u2009m\u2009s^(\u22121)\u00a0(about a category) more intense, on average\"\n\nThat is +19 mph faster wind speeds for 'mericans.  Not much to rely on given the small sample size and large variations in hurricane intensities.  No hurricane has recurred yet like the one which swept waters 10 ft deep over Galveston Island in 1900, killing up to 12,000 people."

                "Content": "Solar panels are cheap now.  I spent the same on the inverter and battery in my recent setup.  But still I calculate \\~10 yr return on investment since I rarely use all the solar output.  I could add more battery, but that doesn't pencil-out against my grid price which is fairly cheap for California (\\~11 c/kWh off-peak).  In San Diego (>50 c/kWh), solar is easy to justify.  But, don't count on using the grid as a \"free battery\" since net-metering is long gone in CA, and following in the rest of U.S.  They now credit only 7 c/kWh for feeding the grid.\n\nThe main problem with Solar (and Wind), both for individuals and the utilities is balancing the load between day and night.  Battery grid-storage is more for green-posing than cost-effective (don't believe everything Elon says).  Pumped water storage is generally better, especially where existing dams can be leveraged.  Perhaps someday, we can share power between U.S. and Asia, since the sun is always shining somewhere.  Can you imagine transmission lines across the Bering Strait?  Even within the U.S., there is little east-west grid sharing due to transmission losses and wiring costs."

                "Content": "This is widely claimed but is basically false. Yes, we can see solar is going up while coal is going down. But what about wind, gas, hydro, nuclear? If it were simply solar going up that caused other things to go down all those should be going down too, but they aren't.\n\nCurrently the vast majority of coal electricity generation is occurring in countries where coal consumption is increasing strongly, dominated by China and India. In those countries solar is growing strongly too, so currently the trends suggest coal+solar dominating in future, maybe solar taking over as number 1, while coal takes second place. But that situation wouldn't produce the trends on the graph - they clearly indicate coal being pushed to the bottom of the pile. This could only be achieved by strict policies being in place which either directly or effectively stop new coal power plants being built in China and India within a couple of years. Then coal declines strongly as old power plants die and no new ones are built to replace.\n\nFurthermore, although there has been a lot of talk about \"The age of electricity\" surrounding this IEA report, this scenario shown actually assumes a sharp decline in electricity growth in China and India, to about half the rate seen over the past decade. This assumes massive improvements in energy efficiency, driven by public policy.\n\nThe availability of solar as an alternative plays a large role of course, but the trends shown could only be achieved with a massive shift in public policy in those countries."

                "Content": "I didn't vote for DJT, but if he halts such federal subsidies I'd be happy.  Too many grifters suck off government teats.  Best example is how Tesla got a great deal on the former NUMMI factory in Fremont, CA and $1B in CA tax credits for their phony Battery Swap Station (open 1 yr, swapped \\~10 batteries), then dissed the state and moved to TX.\n\nSometimes, federal incentives spur progress, but a crap-shoot.  Best thing to come out of the 1970's energy research (began under Pres. Carter) were PV cells and windmills.  Much of the academic funding went toward solar water heating panels, which went nowhere (I've actually seen a few stragglers on rooftops in my neighborhood).  Pumped water storage (ex. 1970's Racoon Mtn, TN demo) is finally growing.  The winners are mostly self-sustaining now, without any government incentives.\n\nMain question is how much the funding helped since we have also seen private funds poured into many ventures, often not paying out.  An early failure was the Scottish Darien Project (Panama, book \"The Rising Sun\") which wasted almost half of Scottish funds \\~1700.  Another example is the Bodie, CA ghost town, which was the 2nd largest city in CA in the 1970's (2nd to San Fran), with investor money flooding into many mines.  Estimates are that the gold found was only 10% of the investment.  Will the private money currently flooding into AI prove similar?  What was the return from all the federal funding of nano, or chaos theory, or fuzzy-logic, or ....?  Battery cars are fine if they pencil-out, but subsidizing rich green-posers who brag about their 0 to 60 times is not."

Lots of people die just from breathing all the stuff we put in the air, plus all these mega-disasters.

The effects of climate change will last for decades, but energy is putting money in people's pockets here and now today. And if it's free to pollute then we aren't paying the real costs."

There have been government reports that suggest it does and that it doesn't.  Without the ability to definitively show it works it becomes too easy call it a money grab. Rightly or wrongly.\n\nWhen the climate crises first came to the fore, I understand there were two theories as to its cause. In short human activity or sun spot activity.

Then it was rebutted and the numbers changed in the 'update'.  While there will always be some who refuse to believe anything, facts still speak to Canadians, and the lack of them leads many who are uncertain to at least remain so.\n\nThe stated purpose of the tax was to reduce emissions by reducing consumption.  As an aside, when you really think about it using taxation policy to price some folks out of the market dies have an elitist flair which is probably why Poliviere' s message has resonated with many. But, including its implementation we have now seen 3 applications of the carbon tax. In the eyes of many the government should be able to say we have reduced consumption by X amount and here are the numbers. But they can't,  won't or don't. But again thier leadership on the issue has been amorphous and thus fails to inspire the uncertain."

My assumption is that it seems unfair because China and India produce more gross emissions than we do. If that's the case, we ought to distribute responsibility equally, sure. \n\nThis is na\u00efve because China and India have far larger populations than Canada, meaning their gross emissions will always be skewed. Unless you are advocating for some form of very fast population control or reduction, I don't think you can do much to address this in the short-term. Now, this doesn't mean that China and India have no part to play. Absolutely they do, but so do we.\n\nWhen you account for population, you find that the per capita emissions of Canadians are significantly higher than that of the Chinese or Indians. We, per capita, contribute more than the Chinese or Indians do. We, as a developed country can and must do more to reduce per capita emissions. This can be achieved through many things like better city planning (that also generally results in more convenience for citizens anyway) and sourcing energy from nuclear and solar for example. That would be part of our role to play.\n\nThe Chinese and Indians must also do their part by being early adopters of these greener technologies, especially as developing nations, to mitigate their inevitable increase in per capita emissions which will have a much larger impact when they do occur.\n\nMost importantly, anthropogenic climate change is not a result of emissions today or tomorrow. It is a result of historical trends that had started at the beginning of the industrial revolution. These historical emissions are significantly from the developed nations being the first adopters of fossil-fuel derived energy for internal combustion engines etc etc and then subsequent reliance of it until recently.\n\nThat being said, individuals can only do so much. It is corporations and the government who need to change how energy is sourced and provided to mitigate emissions and they all largely escape this responsibility.\n\nEveryone has a part to play, and it is industry and government who are not doing their part, in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, you're the one who has something to prove. So instead of asking me for the data, you can go ahead and find it. You will find that, yes, many other countries produce more gross emissions but Canadians are among the largest per capita emitters and it isn't just due to geography and the size of the country.\n\nIf you want to argue it isn't fair China and other countries don't need to take any blame:\n1) Nobody is suggesting they have no part to play in reducing emissions\n2) It is our historical emissions that have driven changes so far\n3) per capita our lifestyles contribute more to emissions than most other countries\n4) the reason other countries have low per capita emissions is because they do not live as lavishly as we do and isn't solely because Canada big and population small."

BC and Quebec are included in the program but collect their own taxes and don't redistribute them at all.  No one gets back more than what they pay in.  Dependents also do not qualify for a carbon tax rebate.  A lot of parents illegally declare their older children dependents to garnish their carbon tax rebate.... most of them probably don't even know it's happening.\n\nOf the 12 million people getting a carbon tax rebate 2 million get paid less back than what they are going to pay in to the tax.  So that means only 25% of Canadians get more from the carbon tax than what they pay in.  It's something that the government specifically tries to hide because they're trying to sell this to Canadians as being in their best interest.\n\nFurthermore, next year checks will be smaller in most provinces.  This is because all of the provinces have aligned with their own large emitters carbon tax removing a large source of income from the federal government's carbon tax.  Now the 75% they redistribute will be coming exclusively from home fuels and gas."

                "Content": ">**The new abnormal**      \n     \n>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2024    \n           \n>**Arctic sea ice continues to be young and thin**    \n      \n>One characteristic of the \u201cnew abnormal Arctic\u201d is a lack of multiyear ice, particularly the oldest and generally thickest ice (greater than four-years old). Multiyear ice was once the dominant sea ice type in the Arctic Ocean (Figure 6). At the end of summer in the mid-1980s, there was over 4 million square kilometers (1.54 million square miles) of multiyear ice and over 2 million square kilometers (772,000 square miles) of ice greater than four-years old. At the end of the 2024 melt season, there was only 1.48 million square kilometers (571,000 square miles) of multiyear ice and only 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) of ice greater than four-years old. Phrased differently, the Arctic Ocean has lost 95 percent of its oldest and thickest ice.   \n          \n>**September 2024 compared to previous years**   \n         \n>Including 2024, the downward linear trend in Arctic sea ice extent for September is 78,000 square kilometers (30,000 square miles) per year, or 12.13 percent per decade relative to the 1981 to 2010 average. Based on the linear trend, since 1979, September has lost 1.61 million square kilometers (622,000 square miles) of sea ice, which is roughly equivalent to the state of Alaska or the country of Iran.   \n           \n>**Another strange year for Antarctic sea ice**     \n        \n>Antarctic sea ice continued to track at exceptionally low extent levels for late winter, and appears to have reached its maximum on September 19 at 17.16 million square kilometers (6.63 million square miles). Averaged for September, sea ice extent stood at 17.06 million square kilometers (6.59 million square miles), just 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 square miles) above last year\u2019s record-setting low monthly average. The last two years have had lower maximum extents than any other years in the modern satellite record by nearly 1 million square kilometers (386,000 square miles). Extent for the past two years has fallen well below levels before the modern satellite era, based on estimates derived from climate indices (Fogt et al., 2022), as well as an estimate for 1966 based on early visible-band, satellite imagery from Nimbus-II.  \n          \n> Figure 7. This graph shows the average Antarctic extent for June through August for multiple decades. The blue line depicts the \u201cbest fit\u201d from 1905 to 2020; the grey line depicts the upper and lower 95 percent range for the same time period; and the red line depicts the modern satellite data from the Sea Ice Index from 1979 to 2024.

In Europe and Russia, a previous study led by Kornhuber attributed heat waves and droughts to fluctuations in the jet stream \u2013 a fast-moving air current that circles the northern hemisphere. \n\nTraditionally confined to a narrow band due to the temperature difference between the frigid Arctic and warmer southern regions, the jet stream is becoming destabilized as the Arctic warms more rapidly than other parts of the Earth. \n\nThis destabilization leads to the formation of Rossby waves, which draw hot air from the south and stall it over temperate regions not accustomed to extreme heat for prolonged periods.\n\nHowever, this hypothesis does not explain all extreme events. A study of the deadly 2021 Pacific Northwest and southwestern Canada heat wave, led by Lamont-Doherty graduate student Samuel Bartusek (also a co-author on the latest paper), identified a combination of factors. \n\nSome were linked to long-term climate change, while others appeared to be due to chance. The study noted a disruption in the jet stream similar to the Rossby waves affecting Europe and Russia. \""

No study has shown that variability in weather has increased, despite constant media claims of that.  A true Climate Change question is why the Arctic has warmed at 4x the rate of the global average since 2000's and Antarctica not at all.  The U.S. hasn't seen a heat wave like what happened in the 1930's (Dust Bowl in western OK).\n\nMeanwhile, in actual science, sea temperature is looking better in 2024.

Neither did she mention how levels of water vapor depends on temperature, and how this makes water vapor a strong amplifying feedback to changes in CO2 levels. \n\nInstead she tried to say that CO2 is not very important, because water vapor is a more important greenhouse gas. \n\nThat is a huge fail.

                "Content": "Increased habitat pressure from recreation is a big one. Wake boats have been controversial and have made a lot of news about how they disturb the lake bottoms and wash out shorelines, but there has been a ton of recreation pressure from wave runners and ski boats building up also. More and more people hitting the lakes for fishing has also resulted in fish populations crashing in some of the more popular lakes and chains. Lead from hunting and fishing has accumulated in the environment to the point that most loon deaths (as shown by some studies) are due to lead poisoning. Eagles are also get lead poisoning so much that I personally suspect they all have it to one degree or another. There has also been massive growth and expansion in ATV/UTV trails cutting through wilderness areas. While they mostly use existing logging roads and other forest roads, the issue there is mainly noise pollution. Those things are very loud and the effects of loud noises on wild animals are well documented. The noise also travels beyond the physical footprint of the trail. Additionally, more homes, many near lakes and other freshwater bodies are getting built and we\u2019ve seen turtle nest destruction from excavators digging new foundations and people landscaping their yards. As more homes get built along shorelines, less nesting habitat is available for species. Some of those species (like loons) are aggressively territorial and end up killing each other. We\u2019ve responded to owl nests, other bird nests, and squirrel nests hitting the ground after people cut down their trees. The people feel bad about it, but didn\u2019t bother or know to try and determine if a nest was there before cutting. I\u2019m sure none of this compares to the damage that rainforest deforestation is causing, but the oblivious way in which humans go about exploiting the environment is the same.\n\nEdit: typos"

This is the highest D0-D4 percentage for any week since November 29, 2022, and it\u2019s not too far behind the record-highest week of 85.28% in Drought Monitor data going back to the product\u2019s creation in 2000.\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/october-is-aiming-to-smoke-u-s-records-for-dryness-and-warmth/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/october-is-aiming-to-smoke-u-s-records-for-dryness-and-warmth/)\n\n>Meteorological drought is simply a lack of normal precipitation, whereas a flash drought is marked by an especially rapid onset or strengthening of drought *conditions* (e.g., agricultural or hydrological drought, related to deficits in soil moisture or water storage). Meteorological drought can occur without unusually warm temperatures, but drought *impacts* are intensifying as a result of human-produced warming that\u2019s increased the prevalence of \u201chot droughts.\u201d\n\nThe article explains how the current drought conditions in the U.S. may be the beginning of a prolonged drought, as occurred in the early 1950s.\n\n>Across more than 1,500 months that populate the NOAA database going back to 1895, there\u2019s only one that has a clear edge on October 2024 for national-scale dryness: October 1952.\n\n>As of October 21, this month has notched about 0.57 inches of precipitation when summed across the contiguous United States, according to climatologist Brian Brettscheider (see embedded post below). Typically, each calendar month produces between two and three inches.....But the extreme outlier was [October 1952](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national/time-series/110/pcp/1/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000), which saw only about half of that amount \u2013\u00a0a mere 0.54 inch, according to NOAA (0.52 inch in the ERA5 reanalysis data used by Brettschneider).\n\nThe article notes that October 1952 drought conditions were a prelude to the great U.S. drought of the 1950s, which \"across some parts of the Southern Plains ... actually outdid the 1930s Dust Bowl in terms of both precipitation deficits and intense heat, forcing [more than 100,000 farms and ranches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_Texas_drought) to close in Texas alone and pushing many thousands of people off the land.\"\n\nOf course the 1950s did not suffer from the impacts of climate change.  A worry should be that the current drought conditions may not be temporary and may actually accelerate, most especially if mankind doesn't aggressively reduce fossil fuel emissions.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fgoeex/earth\\_has\\_its\\_hottest\\_august\\_and\\_hottest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fgoeex/earth_has_its_hottest_august_and_hottest/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fhde02/methane\\_levels\\_at\\_800000year\\_high\\_stanford/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fhde02/methane_levels_at_800000year_high_stanford/)",

A blatant example of Trump's climate change falsehoods are his statements during this campaign about sea level rise.  Yet Harris hasn't even mentioned these specific falsehoods, let alone focused upon them, ignoring the dire consequences of accelerating sea level rise for the nation.\n\nTrump, recently in an Aug. 12 interview with Elon Musk, said:  \"\u201cThe biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean\u2019s going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years \u2026 and you\u2019ll have more oceanfront property, right?\u201d  Yet sea level rise recently on the Southeast and Gulf coasts have averaged about four-tenths of rise ANNUALLY and NASA and NOAA have projected a minimum sea level rise in those regions of 10-18 inches by 2050.  Trump doesn't even understand that sea level rise floods developed coastal areas and inundates existing beaches, nature preserves, and ports.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fcfjyy/comment/lma0tem/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fcfjyy/comment/lma0tem/)\n\n[https://www.vox.com/climate/362478/joe-biden-climate-change-legacy](https://www.vox.com/climate/362478/joe-biden-climate-change-legacy)"

So, it's probably a calculated choice to avoid what could be a hot-button issue for some conservative voters. \n\nNow, based on the enthusiasm of the two bases, it may turn out that she didn't need a large tent.

To the extent Georgia is dependent on tropical storms for rainfall, this factor may be important.  If hurricane seasonal lulls become the norm in August and September, this climate change impact will certainly be a point of focus.\n\n>The most obvious factors in play over recent days, as we noted last week, have been disturbances exiting Africa farther north than usual \u2013\u00a0often ingesting plenty of Saharan dust and dry air \u2013\u00a0and then struggling with limited instability over the Main Development Region between the Caribbean and Africa, the result of exceptional warmth being even more dramatic at upper levels than at the ocean surface. (Meanwhile, the Sahara continues to get phenomenal amounts of rain relative to average, a once-in-a-generation event [covered in detail on Monday](https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/unexpected-rainfall-event-sahara-desert-2024-anomaly-fa/) in a post at severe-weather.eu.)\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/a-placid-atlantic-continues-to-perplex-seasonal-hurricane-forecasters/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/a-placid-atlantic-continues-to-perplex-seasonal-hurricane-forecasters/)\n\nDue to Arctic Amplification, the jet stream is moving north.  As a result, perhaps fewer low pressure events are reaching Georgia.\n\n>The jet stream is moving north. Here\u2019s what that means for you.\n\n>Weather could change dramatically, especially when it comes to rainfall.\n\n>Still, climate models suggest that the stream will march northward and, according to this research, will move outside the historical zone by 2060 in the highest emissions scenarios.\n\n[https://www.popsci.com/environment/jet-stream-moving-north/](https://www.popsci.com/environment/jet-stream-moving-north/)"

The US didn't even peak until around 2005 and has decreased its emissions very little since.\n\nSo, if we look at cumulative emissions china is still at around half of europe's and at around 2/3rds of the US's (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co2-emissions-region?stackMode=absolute&time=1974..latest&facet=none&country=OWID_EUR~CHN~USA).\n\n If we look at per capita emissions the situation is even more unbalanced, with the majority of harm done by very high-income people and countries.\n\nSo, china's path to net zero is by no means perfect, but before criticising it we should take responsibility of our own. We have been setting and ignoring climate goals in the west at least since the Paris agreement, so it looks like even western countries don't give a shit about \"western climate goals\"."

The fun thing about imposing tariffs equivalent to a domestic tax is that Muscovy and China and the rest of BRICS etc *have already agreed to them*.  See [Article II Section 2(a) of GATT 1947](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47_e.htm), agreement to which is a part of their WTO membership.\n\nIn the background, the US has the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://energyinnovationact.org/how-it-works/) which relies on the same tariff idea and also has a carbon tax + dividend scheme.  Not too likely to happen without a significant Democratic trifecta that doesn't depend on Joe Manchin.\n\n> Russia gets 10\u2019s of thousands hectares of new arable farmland and milder weather for every degree increase in global temps\n\nPretty much all of Muscovy's infrastructure that is built on permafrost becomes toast: buildings, roads, whatever.  Melt that and they have no foundations.\n\nWhat new arable land would they get?  A bit of land that hasn't supported significant plant growth in the last few million years, or has had its soil scoured out a few tens of thousands of years ago by glaciers, is agriculturally close to useless soil even if it's defrosted.  You'd have to bootstrap it with fertilizers and spend ungodly amounts of time and resources creating a soil that has organic matter in it and a below-grade ecosystem.  Gets you little or nothing compared to investing the same resources into existing agricultural land.  You'd also have to get all the rocks out of it.\n\n> and China has already said they are playing industrialization \u201ccatch-up\u201d to the West and will not sacrifice growth for reduction to CO2.\n\nChina's a massive importer of fossil fuels so the faster they can wean themselves off it the better off they'll be.  Also they're not dumb, they know that bootstrapping their domestic renewables industries puts them in a great position to export such things too.  This has the side-effect of out-competing their domestic fossil-consuming industries too.\n\n[There are some signs that China's CO2 emissions may be close to peaking or may already have peaked.](https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/china-puts-coal-on-back-burner-as-renewables-soar/)"

Since pro-green-action countries import from China, this would have the effect of reducing the emissions related to the manufactured goods pro-green countries import from China.\n\nFor this to have any meaningful effect, large economies like the US would need to implement both domestic carbon taxes, and import-tariff-carbon-taxes. Of course, that's never going to happen under the GOP, but hopefully, there's a return to sanity in 2028.\n\nStep two would be pro-green countries imposing trade sanctions against other countries for their own domestic emissions (connected to their own domestic consumption).\n\nBoth of these steps would ideally need to be implemented within a global treaty framework so that multiple countries can move in unison, in a pro-green direction, when imposing these policies."

Cheaper batteries for stabilizing the grid and providing electricity everywhere (SDG 7 itself)?\n\nMentioning the fairy tale of cheap nuclear as the first measure disqualifies the whole article. That\u2019s surely not the central solution for the rapid decarbonization that should happen in a significant portion already in the next five years. In addition, existing old reactors will need to be retired in the following years due to increasing maintenance costs.\n\nOtherwise: carbon taxes, subsidizing EVs and heat pumps, phasing out fossil fuels are all policies being discussed and implemented everywhere and nobody really needed this article thanks. \ud83d\ude09 All of that and more is described in the annual [Net Zero Roadmap](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach) of IEA.\n\nEven though it cites the diagram that we clearly need a comprehensive set of policies to address all those areas, it didn\u2019t mention a single proposal for decarbonizing agriculture or industry. Also, efficiency increase is another crucial aspect both in transport (more public transport and vehicle sharing), buildings (energy-saving retrofits) and concerning material resources (e.g. alternatives to cement).\n\nIt\u2019s btw not a \u201csolution\u201d to just say \u201cintroduce some kind of incentives for heat pumps\u201d. It has to be high and comprehensive enough to meet the necessary reduction targets. Obstacles such as high upfront costs even when subsidies are available, lack of qualified workers and regulatory insecurity have to be addressed as outlined in CAN Europe\u2019s report \u201c[Embracing a renewable heating revolution in our buildings!](https://caneurope.org/renewable-heating-barriers-solutions/)\u201d (2023)."

But if China keeps up the pace for decarbonising its grid and replacing coal by solar, the carbon footprint of the produced goods may end being pretty close and won\u2019t be enough to offset the higher EU production cost. Things are not looking good for EU industrial competitiveness."

A 5-10 degree move in just half generation would open up a third of Russia into that zone. Which is why (to me) Russia seems like they could care less about climate change\u2014or even worse, encourage it.\n\nPhilosophically, the climate change debate is essentially a large version of the Prisoners Dilemma: ~216 nations must all work together or none will reap the benefits. In this example, Russia (among a few others) is the one \u201cratting out the others\u201d for a lighter sentence."

Same glaciers that scoured the land and deposited the former soils into Iowa.\n\nWith the BCAM though, there's leverage: decarbonise your economy (or at least fire up a notable domestic carbon tax, leading to much the same thing) or lose your export markets to those who do.  The EU isn't everything but it's certainly a big player on the international trade stage.  Maybe it's big enough to tip world trade over into a carbon tax regime - I hope it is."

Off the top of my head (1) keep their domestic production capacity fully utilised to stimulate domestic economy, (2) keep scale of production high so they can maximise scale and continue to dominate the global solar export market, (3) reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuel imports, (4) reducing cost of electricity, (5) fix air quality issues for domestic health & political reasons.

For instance, he can just appoint people who will tie up agencies in so much administrative BS that nothing gets done, or move certain offices within the EPA to really rural areas knowing that most of the employees would rather quit than upward their entire family to move across the country. \n\nThat said we need to fight like hell for any bit of progress on climate mitigation we can make at the state and local levels. While simultaneously doubling, tripling, quadrupling efforts on climate adaptation. The most recent UN Emissions Gap Report a few weeks ago said we are on Pace for 2.6 to 3.1\u00b0 warming, in my opinion we needed to start preparing for 3+. \n\nWe need to attack adaptation from every conceivable angle: infrastructure, public health, energy, agriculture, etc. And not just through policy.

If you killed off 95% of humanity but kept per capita CO2 emissions the same, you\u2019d have 95% less emissions.

This has denied the biosphere an appropriate time to adapt and evolve to environmental changes. Global warming, at this rate, is going to decimate entire food chains and destroy multiple ecosystems in a slow cascading chain of failure.

Even small delays give us more time to come up with more permanent solutions. The damage from climate change is a gradual process, and the sooner we get this thing into reverse the better, but even just slowing down is better than doing nothing at all.\n\nYou see a lot of climate doomerism amplified online by bad-faith institutions funded by oil companies, and authoritarian oil-producing nations, like Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Fossil fuel interests spread disinformation hoping to convince people that it is \"too late\" to act, so they can continue to line their pockets with cash while they pollute our atmosphere.

Some estimates predict 18 degrees of warming in the next thousand years, which is off the charts insane compared to other warming events.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even considering tipping points. As sea ice melts more heat is absorbed by the ocean and less is reflected back to space. As permafrost in Siberia melts massive methane reserves will be released naturally. These things and others could potentially accelerate warming much faster than humans or natural processes could ever recover from.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance this is legitimately the end of all life on earth, but that\u2019s a WAY bigger statement than the end of humans, which is a WAY bigger statement than the end of civilization."

                "Content": "Knowing how environment conservation works in India, they are probably going to dump bunch of anti-foaming agent to the Yamuna and call it a day\n\n\"the foaming of the Yamuna is the result of multiple factors, including dying water hyacinths in the barrage that release surfactants and the release of untreated wastewater from 18 drains into the river.\n\nAdding to the problem, the Hindon canal, carrying industrial pollutants from sugar and paper mills in Uttar Pradesh, flows into the Yamuna upstream. These pollutants, along with untreated effluents containing phosphates and detergents, pass through the barrage's spillways, where agitation causes the froth to form. The result is a toxic, foaming river.\"\n\n\"Experts have referred to the river Yamuna as completely \u201cdead\u201d - citing the extinction of aquatic life. This is due to the heating up of water temperature in Yamuna due to industrial waste which kills microbes, explains Fanindra Pati, a physics scholar at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU).\n\nBiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measures the amount of oxygen required to break down organic matter in water. A higher BOD means more oxygen is required. This leaves less oxygen for aquatic organisms, which can lead to stress, suffocation, and death. High BOD can indicate faecal contamination or an increase in organic carbon from non-human and animal sources.\"\n\n\"Delhi Pollution Control Board data from June this year shows that the prescribed BOD norm for the Yamuna is 3mg/l or less, but this was met only at Palla in Haryana at 2mg/l. It was 28 times higher than the standard at Asgarpur at 85mg/l, 17 times higher at Okhla Barrage (50mg/l) and 16 times higher at ITO bridge (47mg/l).\n\nDissolved oxygen (DO), which is the amount of oxygen present in the river and the acceptable standard is 5mg/l or above, met the standard at Palla and Wazirabad but was nil at the ISBT bridge, Nizamuddin bridge, Okhla barrage, Agra Canal at Okhla barrage and Asgarpur. Low DO level affects the survival of aquatic life in the river.\""

Humans have only been around for thousands of years; we may well be creating a waste that will far outlive us.  Longterm disposal options usually involved burying it deep in rock.  But when the time scale is millions or years, we have no way of knowing if what is deep rock today will still be inaccessible millions of years from now.\n\nNuclear plant disasters are rare, but when they happen, the stakes and damage are horrible.  Fukushima, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island.  Nobody had heard of these locations until things went wrong.  Where will the next one be?\n\nThe expansion of nuclear energy has gone hand in hand with the expansion of nuclear weapons.  Once a nation learns how to generate nuclear power, they have taken an important step on the road to creating weapons grade nuclear material.  Some countries go down that path, and some don\u2019t."

Also, the nuclear waste issue has not been resolved; nuclear plants have the potential for catastrophic meltdowns so the cost of their insurance is subsidized by the tax paying public to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars per year; and it costs billions of dollars to decommission a nuclear plant at the end of their lifetime, which gets paid by the utility customers (case study: San Onofre Generating Station). There may be occasions where a nuclear reactor makes sense but renewable energy from Solar/wind/geothermal backed up with batteries and fuel cells is cheaper and much safer."

(Apparently more stable than u-239, hence the decay.). Now some of this plutonium will \u201cburn\u201d within the fuel rod, but when the fuel rod is eventually discarded, there are all sorts of plutonium isotopes within the discarded fuel rod.\n\nThe typical process for recycling fuel rods involves dissolving the rod in strong nitric acid, and separating the dissolved metals in a centrifugal process.  I think.\n\nProblem here is, you get weapons grade plutonium from this, which is basically an arms treaty violation.\n\nThat introduces a whole mess of issues with arms reduction treaties, who had stipulations that worried that nuclear energy would (subvert the treaty) and be a back door means to producing weapons grade fissile materials.  Apparently no one that wrote the treaties really considered commercial nuclear waste.\n\nSo combined with these requirements of international law, AND all of the uranium mining companies THAT DO NOT WANT TO FIX THE ISSUES, you now have a boondoggle.  Nuclear fuel rod recycling would decrease demand for uranium mines\u2019 produce\u2026. And with all the regulatory over head and security expenses incurred in that field\u2026 well I can almost see why uranium mining corps treat nuclear fuel recycling as a mortal threat.\n\nThe solution here is not one that is appealing to the western world.  One would want to nationalize the uranium mining industry.  This is a case where I can see a strong argument to nationalization of a VERY SPECIFIC sub-sector.  \n\nMaybe private, profit-interested companies shouldn\u2019t be mining uranium.  There\u2019s a huge risk of diversion within the uranium supply chain, to tinpot dictators who want uranium for weapons.  And the uranium mining interests have been the most vocal proponents AGAINST recycling fuels rods, which has caused a MASSIVE backlog of \u201cused\u201d fuel rods to build up.\n\nThe cost of storing used fuel rods is a massive expense to generators, and that cost gets tacked onto the generators\u2019 customer\u2019s bills."

Climate change is happening now.\n\nIn a sense they are the same as people that hold out on electric cars right now because they prefer to wait on - even longer - ranges or hydrogen fuel or synthetic fuels. Even though we could already cut our driving emissions by something like 80% right now (not even counting scope 3 emissions of drilling for oil, processing it into fuel, transporting oil via ships, or transporting it by truck to gas stations all over the world\u2026 and not even counting charging cars via solar panels or wind turbines, which would even reduce emissions by 100%).\n\nWaiting for perfect solutions is killing the planet and everything on it. We need to lower carbon emissions NOW. \n\nNow beats perfect when it comes to climate change and emission. I once had a manager that I respected very much. He always told me to get started now and to move forward with what I had, because in life, perfect is the enemy of good (enough).\n\nThe fossil fuel lobby did an awesome job of turning people against non-perfect solutions that solutions nonetheless. Whether is is nuclear or electric card\u2026 inaction only helps them\u2026 and they succeed in convincing many people to wait it out some more."

It's not perfect, but it's nowhere near as polluting or dangerous as scaremongers would like us to believe.\n\nHowever, building a new plant is ABSURDLY expensive, and every plant built in the US has gone way over budget and far past its construction timeline. One was recently closed before it even opened after 15 years of construction issues. Again, the reasons for this are unfair and perhaps the industry is subject to too much regulation.  Regardless, there are very few new plants scheduled to open in the near or intermediate future. Barring some new technology or micro-plant idea, the industry will eventually pass away.\n\nMeanwhile, hydro, but especially solar and wind provide a bigger percentage of America's energy production every year. Currently about 1/5th. In China it's almost 1/3rd. The technology improves every single year, and efficiency is increasing faster than any fuel source ever did. And if a wind farm breaks, cities don't get poisoned. :) But more importantly, it's become CHEAPER than coal or natural gas, the two dominant fuel sources at the moment."

And yes, of course the technology has improved since those accidents. But building nuclear plants cements our dependence on a handful of giant corporations. It presumes that political borders will always be stable, that terrorists can\u2019t seize control of a plant, that war or natural disasters won\u2019t destroy it\u2026 for millennia. It presumes the plants will be built according to scientists\u2019 specifications and there will be no cost cutting, either on the building or the maintenance side. \nEver. History has shown this presumption to always be wrong.\n\nThere are newer forms of nuclear energy on the horizon that in theory would mitigate all these issues. But they\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s on the horizon for years now, and meanwhile lots of progress has been made with other forms of renewable energy. So, there will probably be nuclear power included in a mix of energy solutions in the future, but I don\u2019t think it will get us out of the climate change mess."

And right now - what we are doing to the atmosphere is not fixable.  \n\nAlso - I would like to address the magnitude of the issue in the US.  In 2023 our total energy consumption was 26 Petawatt hours.  Our total electricity generation was 4 PWH.  Of that 0.6 PWH came from wind/solar.  Just under 2.5% of our total energy is renewable.  IF we had a better grid and lots of good locations with supportive citizens, we could ramp renewables pretty damn fast.  With a better grid (HVDC / UHVDC) we could wheel power around to mostly address weather variability - and handle the rest with real time pricing and a lot of pumped storage."

Stechemesser et al. evaluated 1500 climate policies that have been implemented over the past 25 years and identified the 63 most successful ones. Some of those successes involved rarely studied policies and unappreciated combinations. This work illustrates the kinds of policy efforts that are needed to close the emissions gaps in various economic sectors. \u201c\u2014Jesse Smith\n\nAbstract\n\nMeeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s climate targets necessitates better knowledge about which climate policies work in reducing emissions at the necessary scale. We provide a global, systematic ex post evaluation to identify policy combinations that have led to large emission reductions out of 1500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 across 41 countries from six continents. Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning\u2013based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO2. Our insights on effective but rarely studied policy combinations highlight the important role of price-based instruments in well-designed policy mixes and the policy efforts necessary for closing the emissions gap.\u201d\n\nWhy is substantive change so difficult?",

The main thing is that there are thousands of little climate policies out there, each of which do a little bit, and together they can do a lot when they're combined together.\n\nJust as there isn't a single tech silver bullet, there isn't a small basket of policies that does it either.\n\nGHG emissions are embedded in so many parts of the economy, that there just isn't going to be a straightforward way to get rid of them all without loads of little policies targeting little niches. None of those policies will show a big effect in themselves, and yet decarbonisation can't happen without them.\n\nWhy is substantive change hard? A bunch of reasons. Tragedy of the Commons, regulatory capture, powerful incumbents, lots of people just don't like change, large problems years away are hard to fully grasp for a lot of people.\n\nAnd millions of years of evolution have taught us that the best and most likely guess for how things will be tomorrow, are that they will be pretty much the same as today.

We already know how bad electrical radiation is, we have to \u201cground\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d our bodies constantly, and we know static electrical radiation wreaks havoc on our bodies, causing many of the pain ailments we see so prevalent today.\nThe only way to slow down emission buildup, is to go back to the 1200\u2019s."

In a guest essay, the journalist and author John Vaillant explains how wildfires in the Northeast are an allegory for the scorching of our political norms: \n\n\"We are being reminded the hard way that we share this world,\" John writes. \"Smoke knows no boundaries, and neither does fire. It\u2019s not a Southern problem or a Western problem; it\u2019s our shared reality,\" he adds. \"This is not just a 'bad year.' Globally, 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, and that record is already being broken. This year is on track to be not only one of the driest autumns in U.S. history since records have been kept but also the first full year in which global temperatures rose 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but when this kind of elevated heat is prolonged, it stresses natural systems, killing marine creatures and making forests and grasslands more flammable.\"\n\nRead John's full essay [here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/opinion/wildfires-new-jersey-new-york-climate-change.html?unlocked_article_code=1.a04.8r6n.Aj_y7gaibFf1&smid=re-nytopinion), even without a Times subscription."

These warnings are common in the West, but they are extremely rare in the Northeast, where I grew up and where my base line was established, my notion of what normal weather is. And I can tell you: This isn\u2019t normal. Back in the 1970s, the idea of wildfires along the I-95 corridor in November was simply inconceivable.   \n           \nUnfortunately, this article is spot on. Global warming is making air temperatures increasingly warmer and hotter around the world. Warmer and hotter air sucks out more moisture from trees, shrubs, bushes, grass, and other vegetation, driving up the potential for increasingly more widespread, increasingly more frequent, increasingly more intense, and increasingly longer lasting wildfires in forest lands, shrublands, bushlands, grasslands, and other land areas with vegetation.       \n          \nFor the most recent 10-year period, from November 1, 2014 through October 31, 2024, this NOAA NCEI Climate at a Glance interactive [chart and table](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/regional/time-series/101/tavg/12/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000&trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=2014&endtrendyear=2024&filter=true&filterType=loess \"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/regional/time-series/101/tavg/12/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000&trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=2014&endtrendyear=2024&filter=true&filterType=loess\") indicate that the U.S. Northeast Climate Region average temperature warming trend is +31.4\u00baF per century (+3.14\u00baF per decade), which is approximately 280% times the whole Contiguous United States average temperature warming trend [+11.21\u00baF](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national/time-series/110/tavg/12/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000&trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=2014&endtrendyear=2024&filter=true&filterType=loess \"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national/time-series/110/tavg/12/10/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000&trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=2014&endtrendyear=2024&filter=true&filterType=loess\") per century, and approximately 354% times the Global Land surface average temperature warming trend [+4.93\u00baC](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/tavg/land/12/10/1850-2024?trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=2014&endtrendyear=2024&filter=true&filterType=loess \"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/tavg/land/12/10/1850-2024?trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=2014&endtrendyear=2024&filter=true&filterType=loess\")   per century ([8.874\u00baF](https://calckit.io/tool/conversion-temperature-interval \"https://calckit.io/tool/conversion-temperature-interval\") per century).   \n         \nIn the Climate at a Glance charts, the temperature trend appears above the top-right corner of the chart window, where toggling [LOESS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/loess \"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/loess\") and _Trend_ hides/unhides the corresponding plot lines in the chart.

                "Content": ">In 2024 (as of November 1), there have been 24 confirmed weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to affect United States. These events included 17 severe storm events, 4 tropical cyclone events, 1 wildfire event, and 2 winter storm events. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 418 people and had significant economic effects on the areas impacted.   \n           \n>...The number and cost of weather and climate disasters are increasing in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity -wind speed, or flood depth, for example - causes at a location), and the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023)). We also know from research using other kinds of climate and weather data that climate change can enhance the frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters - most notably the rise in vulnerability to drought, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and the potential for extremely heavy rainfall becoming more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can worsen hurricane storm surge flooding (Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023)).    \n         \n>In performing these disaster cost assessments these statistics were developed using the most comprehensive public and private sector sources and represent the estimated total costs of these events -- that is, the costs in terms of dollars that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. More than one dozen public and private sector data sources help capture the total, direct costs (both insured and uninsured) of the weather and climate events. These costs include: physical damage to residential, commercial, and municipal buildings; material assets (content) within buildings; time element losses such as business interruption or loss of living quarters; damage to vehicles and boats; public assets including roads, bridges, levees; electrical infrastructure and offshore energy platforms; agricultural assets including crops, livestock, and commercial timber; and wildfire suppression costs, among others. However, these disaster costs do not take into account losses to: natural capital or environmental degradation; mental or physical healthcare related costs, the value of a statistical life (VSL); or supply chain, contingent business interruption costs. Therefore, our estimates should be considered conservative with respect to what is truly lost, but cannot be completely measured due to a lack of consistently available data. Sources include the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Interagency Fire Center, U.S. Army Corps, individual state emergency management agencies, state and regional climate centers and insurance industry estimates, among others.   \n            \n>[Events tab]&nbsp;&nbsp; Event: Hurricane Milton; Begin Date: Oct 9, 2024; End Date: Oct 10, 2024; CPI-Adjusted Estimated Cost _(in Billions)_: TBD; Deaths: 24; Show Summaries: Additional information is currently being assembled that summarizes the damage produced by Milton.      \n           \n>[Events tab]&nbsp;&nbsp; Event: Hurricane Helene; Begin Date: Sep 24, 2024; End Date: Sep 29, 2024; CPI-Adjusted Estimated Cost _(in Billions)_: TBD; Deaths: 225; Show Summaries: Additional information is currently being assembled that summarizes the vast scope of damage produced by Helene."

        "Content": "I posted a complaint on the Massachusetts sub about how newscasters (including on NPR) keep normalizing our insanely warm temps, namely by being happy and excited about it being 80 degrees on Halloween and then referring to temps in the 50s (when it should be the 40s or even the 30s rn) as \"chilly\" and crying \"winter is coming\" after like 7 people said they saw some flakes of snow in NH.\n\nIn response to my post, I got enormous pushback from 90% of people, all saying basically yeah climate change is happening but these are just a few hot days not a trend, why be a jerk about it, and just enjoy the warmth like a normal person. I guess it's cool to love the effects of climate change while still smugging liberal by showing off your belief that climate change writ large is real. It's even more rich coming from a state that prides itself on its \"tough New Englander\" image, replete with putting on tire chains, skating on frozen ponds, and taking the T to ski at Wachusett. Like, none of those things are going to happen this year or probably any that follow...\n\nI've decided that most people think like the following: abnormally warm weather is \"nice\" and, after having experienced a couple weeks of it, anything less than that abnormally warm weather is \"cold\" and thus bad. Like, it's going to be 77 in a couple days here, and I know for a fact that the news is going to say that when it drops to the upper 50s the next day that \"the cold will return\" or something like that, even though the upper 50s are themselves what would've been considered abnormally warm a couple decades ago. \n\nOne comment on another sub I read recently said that they think no one seems to care about climate change since the pandemic. I think that's true. It's like how people are way less aghast by Trump now than 4 (let alone 8) years ago. We're kind of tired, bored, and nihilistic as a nation now. Slouching toward inundation by the seas, mosquitos in January, and a world with no snow forevermore. The first two of these seem to be, for many, worth it so the last one can come true.",

Now, I've literally had people get angry at me if I say that the cold felt nice or that I'm excited for snow to go enjoy. This is new and it is very strange."

So, even if there is a slight difference from the average year, it doesn't feel big. \n\nHowever, this year, the summer has been really long, and the fall is too warm. \n\nThe temperature of Chuseok, which Koreans think of as a holiday in autumn, has exceeded 30 degrees Celsius. \n\nThe peak of autumn leaves is two to three weeks later than usual. \n\nThe date of the the college entrance exam that all Koreans remember, is the second Thursday of November. The date has been so cold that it was common sense to wear a padded jacket for the exam, but this year it was the weather to wear a hood. \n\nIs this only happening in the west of the Pacific Ocean due to the influence of El Nino? I wonder what other regions are like.",

People were saying 'oh, but it's an El ni\u00f1o year, that's why it's late'. This was the first year the skating lakes were closed all season.\n\n2023 5th December and people were still saying it was El Ni\u00f1o. We did not get proper snow, only wet snow, and the skating lakes were all closed again.\n\n2024... Well, at Halloween it was a feels like 27C, I was trick or treating in t-shirt and shorts with my kid and feeling too hot - our first few years it was so cold, we had frost the next day. It's 15th November and we've only just had a frost. It is officially a La Nina year, so it should be back to being bitterly cold, but it's not. Well be back up to 10c during the day again in a few days. It's too warm for November. This summer was so hot and dry, my beans and tomatoes stopped producing, because it was too hot for the plants to produce pollen. It was dry too, except for monthly storms that would drop that whole months rain in a few hours, causing floods. I do not think we will get proper snow, skating lakes, or consistently cold temperatures again this year. \n\nI may not have been here for a long time, but even I have noticed a huge difference.\n\n\nEdit to add some clarifications."

There were FIVE significant hurricanes ($1 billion or more in damage) hit the US.\n\nThis article from the relatively conservative KPMG gives a good overview of why.\n\n[https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2024/october-2024-economic-compass.html](https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2024/october-2024-economic-compass.html)\n\nEconomic estimates of hurricane damage vary wildly. But if the Florida real estate bubble bursts, it could start a domino effect that takes the whole US into a recession.\n\nMany people think that 2024 was a \"one off\"; personally I think 2023 was the \"one off\" with an exceptionally QUIET hurricane season. Hurricane formation is random; hurricane growth is also random. What has changed is that the probabilities for each \"step\" of that growth path go UP with warmer waters.The Pacific cyclone season (which is relatively underreported because Americans don't care about what happens elsewhere in the world) appears to have been about average, but was still very costly overall."

Fossil fuels, however, are C-13 depleted. When we burn fossil fuels, the released CO2 is enriched in C-12 and depleted in C-13. As a result, human-caused CO2 emissions reduce the overall concentration of C-13 in the atmosphere, which is evident in the carbon isotopic signature of modern CO2. Current studies show that the C-13 ratio is -6.5\u2030 of what would be considered \"natural,\" but given the amount of C-13 depleted CO2 release by human emissions, the science says it should be  more around -8\u2030.

                "Content": "The Keeling Curve project shows that the \u03b413C ratio of atmospheric CO\u2082 has decreased significantly over the past century, now around -8\u2030, compared to the pre-industrial baseline of around -6.5\u2030. This decline in \u03b413C is largely attributed to the burning of fossil fuels, which are C-13 depleted. However, this reduction in \u03b413C is not fully consistent with the amount of C-13 depleted CO\u2082 that would be expected solely from human emissions.\n\nPer the Keeling Curve project the amount of CO\u2082 released by humans from fossil fuel burning should, based on the isotopic composition of fossil fuels, have led to a more substantial drop in the \u03b413C ratio. If only fossil fuels were responsible for the increase in atmospheric CO\u2082, the \u03b413C should be much closer to -9\u2030 or -10\u2030. However, the Keeling Curve and other studies show that the observed \u03b413C ratio is not as negative as would be expected from fossil fuel emissions alone. This discrepancy implies that some of the CO\u2082 in the atmosphere is coming from a source that is not C-13 depleted, likely a natural source.\n\nThe Keeling Curve project demonstrates that CO\u2082 levels should have already reached 500 ppm based on human emissions alone. However, natural sinks are absorbing up to 25% of the human-made CO\u2082, which helps keep the atmospheric concentration lower than expected. Because natural sinks absorb predominantly C-12, the \u03b413C ratio in the atmosphere should be higher than it currently is. The observed \u03b413C of around -8\u2030, instead of -9\u2030 or -10\u2030, suggests that other natural carbon sources, which do not deplete C-13, are contributing to atmospheric CO\u2082, accounting for the difference in the C-13 ratio."

We are realizing that things slowly change until the tipping point is reached and a new equilibrium is reached quickly.

I think it is very likely that we see some very drastic changes in the AMOC and general weather patterns in the next 10-20 years and I believe the next President of the United States will have to deal with some extreme ramifications of climate change as we realize just how fragile human society is in the face of climate change, especially given our just-in-time interconnected global system in addition a la Late Bronze Age collapse (which also was seen in the Indus Valley civilization/Late Harrapan) or the Migration period (which led the collapse of the Gupta Empire in India or the Five Barbarian & 16 Kingdom Period in China also due to invasions from steppe horsemen from Central Asia)."

As Fast warming (5-16C increase within decades) has happened in the very recent past, and it occured faster than whats happening now\n\nAs you've been told numerous time, that's local temperatures, not global temperatures. There is no record of global temperature rising anywhere near what is happening today.\n\n> \\- why is the assumption that this time its our fault, or that it's bad?\n\nIt's not an assumption. It's the science based on physics, laboratory experiments, and climate models that accurately project the temperature. It's bad because it causes more extreme weather and sea level rise. \n\n>and speaking of whats happening now - we're told that current global temps are 1.5-1.6C warmer than the preindustrial period - which is generally agreed to be 1850-1900. so lets take 1875 as a middle - to now which is 149yrs. So assuming the warming is linear, its warming at a rate of 0.1C per decade. if you consider thats coming out of a little ice age - 0.1C per decade is pretty mild.\n\nAssuming the warming is linear is false. And you are completely ignoring the fact that the acceleration in warming is increasing every decade. So that of that 1.5-1.6 warming, The last decade was 0.5-0.6C which is 5-6 times your average calculation. \n\n>Of course, in reality, that warming is not linear, its cyclic - we had higher warming from 1910 to 1940, and cooling from 1960's to 1980's, and so on.\n\nThere is nothing cyclic about what is happening now. Global temperatures are much higher than any time since civilization began. \n\n>we are right now at a solar cycle peak, and as solar energies reduce over the next 5-8yrs, so will global temps, cooling into the 1930's.\n\nThe solar cycle is about 11 years which means there have been 8 solar peaks since 1930. Yet there is no correlation between global temperatures and that 11 year cycle. Climate deniers have been saying the temperature will start cooling for the past 50 years and it's never happened. And it's not going to happen now since greenhouse gases are increasing every year."

Baked right into Trump's promises is a literal, direct, clear promise to INCREASE emissions.  His GOAL is to increase emissions, that is what he wants.  There is no gray area about what he will do with emissions.  \n\nSo we are left with this question:  How do we react when we are going to give up on reducing emissions for a while?  The only answer is to take that SUPER long shot of preparing to somehow undo the damage we are causing, since we've basically collectively agreed we aren't going to stop causing the damage in the first place."

Imagine all the freaking trucks that hauled that thing in, and the platform that has to be built, not to mention that it serves as a wind break while possibly slowing the wind as it \"catches\" it. \n\nBut as mentioned here in previous posts: why are we not so upset by the football sized parking lots that we put in for Walmart, Target, etc? \n\nWhy are we not protesting the amount of unused, unsold, and un-donated foods that they put in our landfills? \n\nOur families are so conditioned to accept the big box stores and their waste because \"Things are cheaper there,\" that we look the other way when more and more of them are built - along with deforestation, huge parking lots and the increased pollution around them. \n\nWe need cars to get to all these stores (unless you're willing to get a membership/pay for delivery). We need bigger cars and trucks to tote huge-ass TVs home because we can't live with a small screen - Joe next door has one - we'd better get a bigger one! And a gigantic sound system! And memberships to every movie/TV site! \n\nI'm sick of this constant \"I need, must have, buy buy buy the latest fashion craze\". We condition our kids to believe that a pair of $500 sneakers will make them high-rollers in school. \n\nWe as a community and a people...are sick, sick, sick. \n\nWake up and smell the coffee, folks.

We tend to move forward with these ideas but then stop afterwards to wonder if we are doing more harm than good. \n\nOverall for windmills, the average wind speed across most land regions is increasing due to more energy being put into the atmosphere. I think windmills of this size, if there were more of them, could lessen some of those effects if strategically placed."

                "Content": "In the wind energy sector this is well known. The biggest influence is in the area behind the wind turbine, where the airflow is more turbulent and conveys less energy as some has been converted to the rotational motion of the wind turbine. This zone is called the wake.\nThe wake effects will diminish the further you are away from the rotor and are more intense at the center line of the turbine than towards the edges.\nThe effects are gone after the distance of a few diameters behind the turbine depending on the wind speed and initial turbulence.\nSo for bigger turbines it is a bigger area which is affected.\n\n\nThis plays a role when building a wind farm with many turbines as the influence of the wake of the first row of turbines may lessen energy production of the subsequent rows. \nOn a larger scale this does not influence the wind patterns or other climate factors. The energy taken  from the wind (transformed to mechanical) is only a diminishing fraction of the total energy in the wind."

        "Created": "2024-12-01 15:40:36",
        "Content": "Hey climate change subreddit\n\n**Context**\n\nThought you might find this interesting, especially if any of you might be a little down regarding the potential AMOC collapse that has been in the media in the last year. I know I certainly have been mentally affected by it, so I made up my mind to gauge what the governments internal response has been to the research that has been put out.\n\nI made a freedom of information request to the danish government, more specifically to the danish ministry of climate, energy and utilities in the beginning of november. The ministry and DMI (The Danish Metrological Institute, and it's National Center for Climate Research, NCCR) worked together to create the response to my FOIA request.\n\nI had several calls with a number of public servants in regard to my request, all very valid and nice conversations, before it was delievered in full to me on friday.\n\n**What is the basic TL:DR of the response to my FOIA request (in english)**\n\nthe NCCR at DMI fundamentally disagrees with the methods used in recent major journal articles about an imminent AMOC collapse, as well as the assurity of the conclusions from the reports. Primarily from a source and method reason, as well as how overblown the media perspective has been on the issue.\n\nRegarding the Copenhagen study that made headlines in the second half of 2023, they believe the entire study relies on only a single parameter, which does not even include direct measurements of the atlantics current's flow. Studies on ocean current strength conducted by the NCCR at DMI and the Faroe Marine Research Institute actually show the opposite: the flow is currently increasing, while at the same time, the temperature of the atlantic current is increasing, which is even more concerning for the pace of Greenland ice sheet melting.\n\n[Volumetransport of water \\(million of cubic meters of water per sceond\\) of the AMOC in the last 29 years](https://preview.redd.it/9zktn6j5094e1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=38b809a741e54fe3e6b37ae1d76f7edcd7e16869)\n\nThe latest major study regarding AMOC collapse from the Netherlands in 2024, which also made headlines because it partially confirmed the Copenhagen study from 2023, is considered the first interesting study by the NCCR at DMI since it at least involves several parameters of the currently used complex climate models.\n\nHowever, the NCCR at DMI still find the method problematic because the study is based on an unrealistic premise: a pre-industrial CO2 level over 1,000 years and a Greenland ice melt rate 60-80 times higher than the current rate. This, NCCR at DMI argues, cannot be considered a realistic starting point for evaluating the current impact on AMOC, since the CO2 level is higher, but the melting rate is so much lower at the present moment.\n\nDMI thus supports the IPCC's assessment that a tipping point for AMOC is unlikely to happen within the current century. However, they stress a lot that it is crucial to do everything possible to avoid a scenario where this collapse does become relevant, as each degree of temperature increase raises the likelihood of an AMOC collapse.\n\nIt is also clear that this aligns with the messaging from the ministry and the minister himself in their external communications with the media, which are also entirely in line with DMI.\n\nWhat does not appear, however, is whether the ministry might be preparing reports on the potential impacts of tipping points on Danish industries. From my conversations with both the Climate Ministry and DMI, it is not immediately clear to me that anyone is conducting such studies. The Climate Ministry referred me to the possibility that such investigations would likely be carried out by Dansk Industri (Confederation of Danish Industry) or Landbrug & F\u00f8devarer (Danish Agriculture & Food Council). Which I find concerning, that it would be the lobby organisations doing that research.\n\n**Source:**\n\nI have compiled the materiale for the response of the FOIA here (contains my real name, but so does posts in my profile):\n\n[WeTransfer download link to FOIA request](https://we.tl/t-sBRuM45Qvl) (7 days, or just request it from me in DM)",

And what if any contingency plans are in place to make society at least somewhat able to function in case it should take place. Seems like their reading of the literature makes them trust that it\u2019s not an immediate risk.\n\nI don\u2019t have the scientific background to assess the validity of the studies in question, but it\u2019s a least assuring that there seems to be a methodological/science-based reason for skepticism towards the worst-case scenarios out there. It makes me worry a bit less that we are not just sticking our heads in the sand. Thanks for sharing, OP"

The AMOC has been falling for many decades.  There were several papers recently showing that recent lows were off the charts compared to the past few centuries.  This response wants you to focus solely on the noise in the signal after 2019. \n\nOne of the main points made by this very paper was that we should expect increasing noise in the AMOC as it approaches a phase transition to shutdown, as observed.\n\n>However, the NCCR at DMI still find the method problematic because the study is based on an unrealistic premise: a pre-industrial CO2 level over 1,000 years and a Greenland ice melt rate 60-80 times higher than the current rate. This, NCCR at DMI argues, cannot be considered a realistic starting point for evaluating the current impact on AMOC, since the CO2 level is higher, but the melting rate is so much lower at the present moment.\n\nHere's Stefan Rahmstorf's [response](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2024/02/new-study-suggests-the-atlantic-overturning-circulation-amoc-is-on-tipping-course/) to this exact criticism:\n\n> In the reactions to the paper, I see some misunderstand this as an unrealistic model scenario for the future. It is not. This type of experiment is not a future projection at all, but rather done to trace the equilibrium stability curve (that\u2019s the quasi-equlibrium approach mentioned above). In order to trace the equlibrium response, the freshwater input must be ramped up extremely slowly, which is why this experiment uses so much computer time. After the model\u2019s tipping point was found in this way, it was used to identify precursors that could warn us before reaching the tipping point, so-called \u201cearly warning signals\u201d. Then, the scientists turned to reanalysis data (observations-based products, shown in Fig. 6 of the paper) to check for an early warning signal. The headline conclusion that the AMOC is \u201eon tipping course\u201c is based on these data.\n\n>In other words: it\u2019s observational data from the South Atlantic which suggest the AMOC is on tipping course. Not the model simulation, which is just there to get a better understanding of which early warning signals work, and why.\n\nIn other words, the paper was never intended to be a time-accurate simulation, but instead demonstrates that a sharp tipping point exists in an a CMIP6 model as the forcing is very slowly increased.  The time in the slow change ramp-up which they criticize is a proxy for the forcing strength, and was never intended to represent observed time.\n\nThe large freshwater hosing which they so criticize was required to remove existing massive model salinity biases in the Atlantic.  The size is a measure of how far off existing models are from reality.  Why are they so sure that the AMOC can be better represented with biased model salinities which are far off from those actually observed?\n\nFinally, the heavily hosed model does a much better job of matching the observed AMOC variability.  Obviously it would be better to have a model which natively produces the observed salinity, but why is it that they are so confident that the model which gives much worse results for AMOC variability is more correct?  Where does the expressed confidence come from, with an issue like this where it is so vital to not be wrong?"

Too rapid a pop to be explained by human CO2 emissions. They are still trying to explain it.\n\nAn early thought was increased water vapor from the 2022 Hunga Tonga undersea volcanic eruption (water vapor much stronger GHG than CO2), but perhaps too delayed for that to have been the main cause.  James Hansen's group suggested a decrease in aerosols from ship exhausts after a recent international change to low-sulfur fuels.  Perhaps a combination of factors.  The later factor is likely not primary since ship fuel didn't change in 2024, yet the planet temperature has stopped rising and has begun returning towards normal, both for air and sea surface.  That suggests we haven't identified all important factors.\n\n[https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/t2\\_daily/?dm\\_id=world](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/t2_daily/?dm_id=world)\n\n[https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst\\_daily/?dm\\_id=world2](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/?dm_id=world2)"

People worry about the wrong things, and focus on the first order effects (like rising temperatures) and second-order effects (like sea level rise).  The actual dangers will be social and economic changes that are *driven* by these fundamental climate shifts.\n\nWorst case estimates for sea level rise by 2100 are for about 18 inches.  Do you live more than 18 inches above sea level?  Good, sea level rise is not going to be what gets you.  We\u2019ll probably be at about 3C by 2080.  How do you do during a heat wave?  Sweat a lot, but you survive?  Good, it won\u2019t be the temperature.\n\nBut there will probably not be a Singapore in 2080.  There will probably also not be the concept of \u201ccountry\u201d.  Why?  Because the 4th-order effects of a changing climate is more severe weather.  The roughly 6th-order effect is migration away from places where it is less hospitable to those where it is more.  When governments are already weakened from keeping out the poor desperate migrants, and the cost of food has gone up from failed harvests, and the cost of everything else has gone up from the economic drain of rebuilding things that severe weather destroys, and then a typhoon comes through and floods the city, the social contract is broken.  People will not trust their government to take care of them. Hell, I dunno what it\u2019s like in Singapore now, but in the U.S. right now people already don\u2019t trust the government to take care of them.  And when they don\u2019t believe they get anything out of the social contract, they won\u2019t uphold the social contract.\n\nThat\u2019s what will get you.  Not the temperature; not the ocean, but the general decline of people giving a fuck about social order and instead turning to crime, tribalism, fraud, and violence."

Then that potential generation dies off. Think about this for every animal confused about when to reproduce and then you start to understand phenological mismatch.\n\nI live in northeastern MN, it has been 10 to 15 degrees higher than average for each season...trees will start dying in mass if winters continue to be too warm. I predict this will happen with 10 more above average winters. I am in the process of planting more heat tolerant species on my property to compensate, no longer should any of us just focus on heat intolerant natives.\n\nPhenological mismatch will continue to lead to mass extinction at an unprecedented rate. Animals use weather and temperature variants to signal when to start or stop life cycle phases.\n\nLook at the \"hot models\" who were once the supposed outliers in the last IPCC report...those, once deemed too extreme to even consider, are now predicting current weather patterns much more accurately than we thought they would. It is very likely we are going to see temperature variants that will lead to things like mass extinction, crop failure, drought, and extreme weather events unlike we've ever seen way before 2100. \n\nUnfortunately, silent spring will be here much sooner than we predicted."

They determine that their facilities are (supposedly) at relatively low risk from flooding, say, and then conclude that they have almost no exposure to climate risk. \n\nBut those cascading social, economic, and political impacts are going to impact everyone and all organizations. Climate is going to bankrupt municipal and then state budgets. When there's not enough money to pay for roads and schools and healthcare things are going to get very ugly.

Altogether we're looking at billions of climate refugees, probably. \n\nGovernments in the global north will continue on a trajectory of authoritarianism, nationalism, xenophobia, and fascism. It is their natural tendency to do so when the people are motivated by fear and scarcity. This will result in lots of conflict, not just against the migrants, but also internally, and against other governments, as countries compete for dwindling resources. \n\nClimate outside of the tropics will be more survivable, but will still be harsh. Heat waves, flash flooding, drought, etc. will constantly threaten any stability. Supply chains and energy infrastructure will be stressed to their breaking points.

Crimes of desperation will rise as people loot, steal, and rob for food.\n\nI imagine there will be places where people can survive and live a relatively comfortable lifestyle. Rich countries like Canada, the Nordic countries, maybe Japan and Korea, will have small places where a small group of people can live a life mostly if not entirely indoors, underground, powered by their own decentralized power grids running off of solar or wind. They will likely need to use technology to grow food indoors, hydroponically. These small enclaves will be reserved for rich people who can afford to build them, and they will live under threat of the hungry masses at their doors.\n\nI believe that humans will ultimately survive climate change, but our population will collapse, our global community will vanish, and we will return to tribal bands of scavengers for a long, long time while Earth heals."

Climate science tells us that severe weather events will continue to become more frequent and more intense. Droughts and wildfires will become more severe. Heatwaves will come more often and be more severe. \n\nI think just as the human brain struggles to comprehend exponential growth it has a hard time processing this notion that the crisis will get worse and worse and worse for a very long time. Wars end. Pandemics end. Economic recessions end. I'm not sure we have any model for a crisis that just gets worse indefinitely (at this point probably for at least several decades--if we're lucky). \n\nWhat happens when more money every years goes to dealing with disasters leaving less money ever year for things like healthcare and infrastructure and education? What happens when the disasters increasingly outstrip our financial and human resources to deal with them, getting worse and worse?"

You don\u2019t really want hordes of migrants descending upon you; even if you have a plan to embrace them, they stretch the housing supply, the city infrastructure, the social fabric, etc.  Rapid population growth is often more destructive than the effects of climate itself.\n\nAlso many people underestimate the impact of emergencies and black swan events.  Sea level rise, increasing wet bulb temperatures, rainfall, storms did nothing to New Orleans until Hurricane Katrina hit, and then it lost 1/3 of its population in a year.  Similarly the Great Lakes region is vulnerable to the polar vortex destabilizing and a large polar airmass sweeping down over the Midwest like one did last winter.  All it takes is a grid-down event in -40 temperatures and lots of people will die."

Then around 2000, it started to level off.  Then around 2010 it started going up faster than ever.  For the last decade climate scientists have been talking about this and now it's becoming confirmed that the recent acceleration is from tropical wetlands. The climate changes humans have already caused, have now tipped Wetlands into a significant methane source. It's quite interesting to learn about the studying of carbon Isotopes, satellite data, and local monitoring to determine the methane is being driven by the heating up and flooding of tropical wetlands. \n\nRegarding peak oil, I know you've heard your whole life that we're gonna run out of oil.  You've heard it so much because it's true.  Sure, maybe some people have got the timing wrong, but it's gonna happen. And it's not running out of oil that's gonna break us. We will break when we can no longer grow our oil supply.  If we start consuming less oil year over year,  that will lead to our societal breakdown."

                "Content": "A current example is that agriculture is getting less reliable in parts of the Americas, causing more food insecurity, poverty, and even worse governance. This leads to migration, but the world is already populated everywhere that's good to live in, and those people will resist migrants. We're already seeing a retreat from friendly international relations, and increasing fear and conflict will fuel more fear and conflict. A society under stress doesn't do long-term investments like infrastructure well, and stressed societies seem to gravitate toward authoritarianism and away from science and education. Our improved tech means that natural disasters kill fewer people, but the monetary damages are rising, adding another strain on an already-strained economy. Some of our infrastructure is brittle, like the vulnerability of electrical grids to sabotage. An example from Annie Jacobsen's book Nuclear War is an electromagnetic pulse from a bomb detonated high in the atmosphere. It knocks out everything electrical over much of the U.S., like control systems in water distribution, gas pipelines, all newer cars, telecommunications, etc. (a lot of infrastructure exploded or stopped working in that chapter). Considering how much the pandemic alone disrupted the flow of the economy, it's not hard to imagine rising conflicts and isolationism tanking economies in lots of places. Infectious diseases will be more of a problem in a warming society with increasingly sketchy governance. The Spanish flu killed more people than WWI, so disease could be one of the biggest impacts. Like others said, the floods and droughts and wildfires and heat waves are bad but they're not the things that will have the most impact in the next several decades."

The problem is not that average temperatures go from 80 to 85; it's that a 100F day would previously have been unheard of, and now you may have 2-4 weeks of it.  That will kill all sorts of people on the margins of society (those who can't afford A/C, basically), make it much harder to work outside (which exacerbates a problem, because construction is one of the main ways we'll deal with climate change), and contribute to the general fraying of the social fabric."

It feels like most articles focus on how we\u2019re screwed or how we should\u2019ve acted 20 years ago to avoid catastrophe. And they\u2019re right, but it feels so fucking overwhelming after reading it over and over. It\u2019s important to know how badly we\u2019re screwed but it feels like too much sometimes.\n\nI really appreciate the posts that offer a bit of hope\u2014showcasing the incredible work of the world\u2019s smartest minds, the new laws being passed, and the breakthroughs in science and business that give us a bit of a chance. Those stories remind me that progress\u00a0*is*\u00a0being made.\n\nFor those in the same boat as me, I recommend reading a few positive articles every day. Here are a couple of good sites I\u2019ve found:\u00a0**Environment America** and\u00a0**The Daily Climate**\u00a0tend to have a more balanced and optimistic tone. They also gather news from multiple sources. Personally though, I\u2019m also looking for more stories about business and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nI\u2019ve also recently started an email newsletter called\u00a0**Extant**, with informative, positive articles I\u2019ve read and liked in the past few days. I send news in four categories: *science, business, politics, and activism*. If you\u2019re also tired of the doomscrolling, feel free to join here: [Extant](https://extantclimate.org). 2 emails per week, just articles. No ads, nothing.\n\n(edit) I fixed the link above, it was glitching out. In case you all were signing up before.",

Not to discredit the ongoing research and climate science, but as always, the current model of the future can and likely will change."

                "Content": "The key point to understand is that the planet is not facing a \"climate crisis.\" It is undergoing a human-induced climate shift, but to the Earth itself, it makes little difference. There have been multiple periods in Earth's history when CO2 levels were 5-6 times higher than they are today, with global temperatures up to 15\u00b0C warmer. The Earth will continue, largely unaffected. \n\nThe real issue lies in the fact that humans will need to adapt to these changes. The situation is labeled a climate crisis because people don\u2019t want to move or invest in new infrastructure, and it will ultimately cost to much to try to preserve things as they are now. \n\nEcosystems will change, deserts may become jungles, and jungles may turn into deserts. Coastline will flood and people will have to move. We call these changes catastrophic because we've built infrastructure in specific areas, and it will be expensive to relocate or adapt. However, humanity is not facing extinction. We will adapt, though likely reluctantly. Ultimately, the driving force behind many decisions is economic, the almighty dollar.\n\nI wonder what the future will look like in a couple of hundred years. For example, as Antarctica warms, it will likely become free of ice, revealing a whole new continent to explore. Greenland changing into an archipelago with what may be three main islands, featuring the largest lake in the world, surrounded by towering mountains. Just between these two regions, we possibly could gain more than 6 million square miles of new land, offering significant changes to Earth's geography."

That\u2019s no way to live. It\u2019s like living in dread because the sun will die in the future. \n\nOr you can breathe and realize that there\u2019s still plenty of time to engineer a solution.  Fusion power looks promising for example - AI and Quantum computing will feature in the solution as well.  \n\nRemember how we fixed the hole in the Ozone layer?  We fixed Acid rain, we fixed a LOT of publicized disasters. I am 100% certain we will fix this issue too.  Look at the other subs like Uplifting news - the planet today is greener than it was 40 years ago! \n\nThere is plenty to celebrate that you\u2019ll never see if all allow the algorithm to just show you the worst case news stories.  Retrain your algorithms or better yet - get offline and go out and connect with real people. \n\nHumans, for all their faults, are ingenious little buggers - climate change"

For persons well familiar with the AMOC threat, these paragraphs from late in the article may be most informative IMO (BF emphasis added).\n\n>Once corrected and recalibrated, the cable data were in much closer agreement with the other platforms, showing no significant change in the Florida Current during the past 40 years of measurements. **And because the Florida Current is such a large part of AMOC, the corrected data cuts the observed decline from 2004 to 2022 in total AMOC transport almost in half, from an original drop of about 14% to a revised drop of about 8%....**\n\n>So in summary, we have at least some reassurance from the North Atlantic data that a full-on AMOC collapse hasn\u2019t begun. And it\u2019s unlikely that any future collapse would reach its end point any sooner than the early to mid-2100s. **Yet there\u2019s also legitimate concern \u2013 stoked by recent work from climate modelers and statisticians \u2013\u00a0that a tipping point toward eventual collapse could arrive as soon as the next several decades, especially if fossil-fuel emissions aren\u2019t cut sharply.**\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/12/atlantic-circulation-collapse-new-clues-on-the-fate-of-a-crucial-conveyor-belt/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/12/atlantic-circulation-collapse-new-clues-on-the-fate-of-a-crucial-conveyor-belt/)\n\nBecause climate change impacts are interrelated, I wonder if discussions of the AMOC are paying insufficient attention to accelerating collapse of the Greenland ice shield as global temperatures increase and to the possible impact of wind stilling on the AMOC.  Just accurately measuring the AMOC may be insufficient in accurately projecting the future impact of climate change on the AMOC.\n\nUnfortunately few Americans understand the impact of a slowing, let alone collapsing AMOC, if they've even heard of the AMOC.  The potential impact on U.S. East Coast sea level rise is rarely (more likely never) discussed in the media or by politicians.\n\n>Surface air temperatures over northwestern Europe could plunge far below current readings, even in a world otherwise warmed by human-produced greenhouse gases. Everything from agriculture to migration patterns could be profoundly affected. More modest drops in annual temperature, mainly during winter, could spread as far as the United States as well as encompassing most of Europe. And the average sea level could jump by as much as a meter (3.3 feet) along the U.S. East Coast, on top of the higher water produced by warming oceans and melting ice.\n\nAlso, rarely (never?) discussed is how much ocean heat content will rise off the South and East Coasts of the U.S. as the AMOC slows, reducing the heat transfer to the North Atlantic.  Higher ocean heat content will impact storm intensities and damage, atmospheric temperatures, and ocean thermal expansion and sea level rise.",

I understand feeling like we are each just a person and we each don\u2019t matter. But that\u2019s not true!!!! I downloaded this Common app to see how much emissions (estimated) I generate myself from just doing day to day life. It\u2019s really put a lot of choices in perspective for me!!!! I am boycotting shopping at target / Walmart / Amazon for myself. I also found a coop to shop for groceries (has goods from local farms and dairies) so I\u2019m phasing out Kroger (evil) and the like as well. I am making a point to only thrift my clothes and walk/bike anywhere that\u2019s under 2 miles away. \n\nI\u2019m learning that these are not \u201cconvenient\u201d choices but IM FUCKING SICK OF THAT ARGUMENT TOO. It\u2019s not a NECESSITY, getting everything you want with next day shipping- whatever new Stanley cup trinket or fucking shittily made textile item that unravels in 2 washes and will end up in a textile waste landfill in Kenya or some shit. Americans (and many westerners as a whole) would die before sacrificing convenience. You can make these daily changes. You have no clue how much emissions even filling up the gas tank causes. All of this being said I am really pissed off. You can choose to make differences each day in your community. Get work clothes at Goodwill (and not Marshall\u2019s /Amazon ffs). Turn off your air conditioner when you\u2019re not home. Open windows. Consume less. Stop following micro trends. I get asked why I don\u2019t have tiktok- it\u2019s so I don\u2019t get influenced. Deleted that shit and never miss it. Now I don\u2019t have to be concerned about clothing and stuff trends I don\u2019t even know exist. STOP USING FUCKING PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES PLEASE!\n\nPlease please give a shit. It\u2019s not fair to the animals and nature and the earth nor is it fair for the communities and individuals who are trying their hardest for you to take a dump on their efforts in the name of convenience.

                "Content": "What I'm about to write is going to sound self righteous but i really just mean it as an example of how someone can live a lot better with a lot less in the US just by differentiating between \"need\" and \"want\" and living strategically. Eventually, your good habits replace the bad ones and the good ones are just as hard to break. Sure, easier said that done but... at the end of the day, true. So, here's briefly our example and I'm happy to share details with anyone interested. We live well... comfortably ... and with higher levels of efficiency and functionality than ever before and we do so on a really modest salary by living strategically (frugally). For example, we are fortunate enough to have home in a place with four seasons and our utility bills are never more than about $30 / month average for water, electricity, heat/cool, and propane. We strategize our way through the seasons using demand-side economic strategies and lots of passive techniques (some behavioral, some retrofit into our conventional construction. We even removed most of the chemicals from the house (e.g., we made our own indoor paint out of clay collected during a car trip to the red-rock country of AZ). We eat healthy and waste nothing (worms, chickens, etc.) and produce about a small plastic grocery bag of garbage a week (family of four) and save enough to allow us to take weeks and month long trips (camping) for a few hundred bucks max. All the neighbor's trash gets knocked over on trash day by the wild animals... ours sits undisturbed as it slowly accumulates for weeks or longer. Sure, we are super privileged to live in the US... and to be in the position we are in... but we do well by doing good... our lifestyle focuses on quality of life instead of standard of living. And we are motivated to live simply and really well by all those earthlings in the world less able to manage or who are downtrodden (or worse). We'd choose to live simply even if we weren't also living far better. So, we do what we can. This is not some holier than thou sharing... although i know i sounds like that. Rather, it's just a simple example of what we are doing (and what many of you can do too) when one differentiates \"need\" from \"want\" and learns to be handy about the house. True, we still use 100x more than a family of 30 in Maasailand, but we run as lean as we can given that we live in a system that is wasteful and inefficient. I hope this is more inspirational than off-putting. If anyone is interested in the details, I can share some with you or you can ask specific questions.\u00a0 I guess if you really wanted, you could take me on a video tour of your home and I could give you suggestions. I've done this with my friends and have saved them hundreds / month in utility bills. hope this helps everyone... happy retrofitting and establishing new better habits to replace the less good ones."

Next time it needs paint use a light-colored INFRARED REFLECTIVE  paint; next time it needs a roof use light colored or white (best) infrared reflective roofing. You might cut your A/C bill to almost nothing.\n\n\\~Half the sun's radiation is visible light, which turns to heat when absorbed: \\~half is infrared, which is already heat. Petroleum-based (the pigments) white paints can absorb IR as if they were black. Your walls/roof get hot, and radiate their own infrared right through insulation into your house: fiberglass doesn't even see IR. White/very light pastel colors reflect visible light back to space, so it doesn't warm the planet, let alone your house. Metal/metal oxide pigments can reflect the IR back to space, too. Titanium dioxide works well, but there is a barite? Barium-based--artists' pigment now being used in paints that is as white as white gets, that reflects away visible light, IR, AND UV, which titanium absorbs. My south wall is an IR reflective light pastel blue, and my roof an IR reflective \"sage\"--the damn roofer did not give me the option of choosing the color--and I stay comfortable on rare 100-degree days in Portland (the one on the left) just sitting in front of a fan in the evenings.\n\nPart of what lets me do that is a night flush: any cool night, I open strategic windows, put a fan in one, and draw cool air through the house all night, then keep it closed up during the day. Sorry that won't work for you in the South/Midwest: between that and tornado alley, I wonder why anyone lives there. But that's just me.\n\nIf you're thinking about installing A/C, check into Sky Cool instead. Super reflective panels that also use halfnium oxide to emit IR to the cold of space, even on a hot sunny day, Sky Cool is supposed to keep whatever it cools 15 degrees C--not F--cooler than the surroundings. YOu need a small pump to move the anti-freeze solution to your air handler, but that's all the power it consumes; much less than an A/C.\n\nBTW: if you were to live in a Hobbit house, in tornado alley, your house might stay cool summer/warm winter on a fraction of what you now spend heating/cooling, and designed right it could be utterly tornado proof AND fire proof. Build it with Blue Crete geopolymer cement, which self insulates and self waterproofs, and it might cost you half what conventional construction would cost, and it might still be sheltering families thousands of years from now.\n\nBut that's another rant."

                "Content": "You're very welcome. Someone finally getting something out of my hard (research) work. Yay!\n\nGo here: [www.ptbocc.com](http://www.ptbocc.com) . Read the Rant on concrete--it's the second or third--then download the review copy of the  book you'll find there, or read it online. You'll find the whole chapter on concrete fascinating, but serious discussion of Blue Crete begins on P 286. Some of the endnotes might be out of date, but google **Blue Crete (cement)** and **Blue World Sciences**, and you should find what you need, including contact information. Know that Panitz answers his phone better than he returns emails.\n\nBlue Crete is a geopolymer, so it won't begin to crack and crumble in 40 years, like Portland cement concrete; it will \"cost\" \\~ 1/10 as much carbon to make, and if you use bamboo, which it should protect from fire and rot for centuries if not millennia, for rebar, you can sequester some carbon in the structure. And, yeah, I just said that your house might last millennia. Think that might improve its resale value, should you ever?\n\nDeveloper Daniel Robert Panitz, Pompano Beach, Fl, has been claiming for at least 14 years that with the right aggregates, Blue Crete superinsulates to an astounding R17.5/inch. I understand that 4 inches of OPC is enough for a dome;  BC has up to 3 times the compressive and 7 times the tensile strength of OPC, so you'd need less.  Two inches would be well insulated, three, nicely superinsulated, especially if you burried it, and much stronger than you'd need, which is rarely a  bad thing.\n\nSuggeston? Do a round basement, or slab floor, of BC, unless you want a cool corner in the basement: then do that section of basement wall and floor in a non-insulating geopolymer cement, and insulate that corner from the rest of the basement. If you want some passive solar heat storage, leave a recess in the ground floor BC slab, behind south glass, and fill it with Ferrock pavers. Or flagstone ... . Put up an inflatable dome form, and spray on a layer of BC with wood chip aggregate: still fireproof, takes and holds nails and screws, so you can attach walls fixtures pictures anywhere inside, and you can cut it with woodworking tools. Make it 1.5 inches thick, and I'm sure you could climb it. Cut holes, install electrical boxes, then staple on bamboo reinforcing. Install wiring on top of that, so that it is well into the second layer and out of reach of screws from inside, and trowell on a second layer of BC, with stony aggregate. BC is hydrophobic. You won't even need to waterproof it.\n\nBTW: out of ground, use large aggregate in that second layer of BC crete, or finish it with Ferrock pavers, or flagstone, and you could pretty easily make it small-arms proof. Just sayin ... . And it would  be so utterly fireproof--refractory to 2700 d F--that it would be your refuge, not your pyre, in a wildfire. \n\nPanitz says a plant to make BC should cost 5 to 10 percent the cost of an OPC plant. It takes far less expensive energy to produce BC than OPC, and you can use almost any aluminosilicate, 3/4 of the surface of the earth, already-crushed mine tailings, fly ash and slag. Think that might bring the cost down, once Blue Crete is in widespread use?\n\nI wish you could let me know how your house turns out, but I see no way you can PM me here. If you leave a response to the Rant on concrete on the PTBOCC website, I'll see it there. Guess that'll haveta doo....\n\nHappy homebuiding!\n\nOh, hey, if you plant timber bamboo on your land right now, the right varieties just might be ready to use by the time you get around to building."

In fact, telling Americans that they need to give up meat to slow down climate change is part of why there is so much resistance in the US.  And remember that increasing meat consumption is one of the first things that happens when a society (or a person) escapes poverty.  \n  \nNor is it, in fact, as simple as that.  Absolutely, we need to stop clear cutting forest to make room for pasture.  We need to end feedlots and other forms of high intensity production and return to restorative agricultural practices.  Done correctly, rotational grazing and silvopasture actually improve the soil and retain significant amounts of carbon dioxide.  \n\nProject Drawdown offers a detailed analysis of how shifting to a more plant based diet can help bend the curve towards slowing climate change.

                "Content": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00768-1\nI hate when they say 'a paper' and give absolutely no sourcing \n\nThey totally gloss over the fact that the paper is about the costs of *1* strategy to solve *1* tipping point, that the actual cost of missing the tipping point depends on multiple factors and isn't just '4 times', and that it uses a very simplified model with limitations as to what it can capture. They clearly didn't read past the abstract, in fact all of this information I got is in just 2 paragraphs in the intro, science 'journalism' is a joke and probably a significant reason so many people don't believe in science anymore \n\n\"The present study aims to bridge these gaps by estimating and analyzing a spatiotemporal, closed-loop, albedo-based control strategy that is optimal with respect to a prescribed cost function, for stabilizing or reversing sea-ice loss in the vicinity of a tipping point. To this end, we use a simple energy balance model (EBM) to represent climate dynamics. This EBM has a tipping element that arises from the strong nonlinearity associated with the increased reflectivity of sea-ice or ice-albedo. The simplicity of the EBM allows us to employ an analytical approach by framing the question of control as a PDE-constrained optimization problem.\n\nWe succeed in devising an optimal control scheme to stabilize sea-ice while minimizing the cost of applying this scheme, by employing variational methods. Essential features of the tipping point, such as the critical threshold and the strength of hysteresis, can be quantified and tuned by varying the parameters of the EBM. This allows us to study the dependence of control measures on tipping point attributes. We find that the EBM can be controlled around the sea-ice tipping point and that the control is most cost-effective when applied near the ice-edge. We show that the control intervention required to reverse sea-ice loss nearly doubles once the system starts undergoing a rapid transition to the ice-free state or \u201ctipping\u201d. We also explore the possible delay in the onset of tipping or an overshoot past the tipping threshold due to system inertia and how this affects the scaling of control costs with the time of deployment. An increase in the system inertia allows for a larger time window for intervention during which the requisite control scales linearly with the intervention time; past this limit, there is a steep rise in the costs. And our studies show that the larger this leeway, the larger the cost of reversing sea-ice loss once the window is crossed. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal maximum of control required in the post-tipping scenario is an order of magnitude higher than that of the pre-tipping case. These results have important implications for intervention strategies and policy design related to the prevention of catastrophic climate change.\"\n\nEdit: they *technically* do mention that this is about one tipping point, but frame it as general, then later say that the paper was a \"case study\", also they do mention that the costs vary, but only inside the quotes of others and never specify that those quotes are about different things and that the cost of any one tipping point is generally not generalizable"

                "Content": "I totally get your frustration. It\u2019s so common for people to reference \"a paper\" without giving any proper citation, which really weakens the argument they\u2019re trying to make. The paper you're talking about is very specific\u2014it\u2019s focused on the costs of a single strategy for managing one particular tipping point, namely sea-ice loss, and it\u2019s crucial to note that the costs are not as simple as \"4 times.\" The real costs depend on a variety of factors, and missing the tipping point doesn\u2019t just have a straightforward multiplier effect.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more irritating is how the media or science journalists often skim over the nuances. They fail to mention that the paper uses a very simplified energy balance model (EBM), which, while useful, has clear limitations. The model doesn't capture every aspect of the system, and it\u2019s designed to answer specific questions within those constraints, not to offer an all-encompassing solution. The real meat of this is in the intro, just a couple of paragraphs, and anyone who cares about understanding the paper should read beyond the abstract.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right\u2014this kind of shallow science reporting contributes to the mistrust of science in the public sphere. When key details are glossed over, or when findings are oversimplified, people are bound to misunderstand the complexity of the issues, which ultimately hurts the credibility of scientific research. It\u2019s an important issue, especially when dealing with something as critical as climate change, where the subtleties matter."

                "Content": "I firmly believe that climate change is primarily a class issue, and viewing it as such lends itself to a fairly clear extrapolation of the future based on present circumstances. Bearing the limits of predicting the future in mind, this is how I see things playing out: I believe that once we start to hit the tipping points, the present greenwashing will turn into something that is ostensibly more urgent and conscious of the gravitas of the situation, but it will merely be a more elaborate imitation of action. Depending on the portent for liberal democracy\u2014which at present appears bleak\u2014deliberate censorship and/or algorithmic manipulation will limit dissent and perpetuate the facade of action. Once resource scarcity and geopolitical instability render socioeconomic stratification politically irreconcilable, I think that this sort of soft fascism that begins with Trump's second term (and presumably will proliferate throughout other Westernized powers) will be forced to exert more extreme authoritarian measures to maintain social order. From here, things become a bit murkier, but I would expect there to be a point around the midcentury at which AI and robotics become so advanced that the oligarchs can essentially ditch the nation-state system, as they will be able to rely on their technology for defense and self-sustenance. By the end of the century, I think we'll see a techno-feudalist society\u2014one in which the oligarchs will no longer need to engage with the masses at all, but will choose to in order to maintain their conscience (egalitarianism will still be too recent for even minimal humanitarian sentiments to be absent). They will essentially act as monarchs until things get so bad that THEIR lives are in danger, as even their technology will be unable to subvert the Earth's will. At this point, the ruling class will be the only humans that remain, and they will either survive and attempt to start global civilization anew in light of a long-awaited reflection, or they too will be wiped out. \n\nOf course, this is all HIGHLY speculative, but it is my best guess at how things will transpire. Perhaps humans and AI can realize nuclear fusion and temper the effects of climate change therein, or maybe Elon Musk or some other maniacal billionaire (or trillionaire) will actually try to set up a human colony on Mars, which will likely fail to save our species from extinction in any meaningful way. Likely, some permutation of the above and unforeseen events will usher in a future that will not be kind to the masses, but this is not to say that we should give up. I am undoubtedly a pessimist, but that's based on my own mental calculations of what is most probably given what we know right now, not a conviction that I can predict the future with any certainty. History is not over, and we must continue to fight for a more equitable SOCIETY in which the interests of the middle and working classes are taken into account."

Or how about the Swedish chemist, Servante Arrhenius who first described the damaging effects of to much C02 in the atmosphere, back in 1896. Have you read about the Keeling Curve, started in the 1950's? Just because you were not educated about the greenhouse effect in the 70's, doesn't mean that other people were not educated with the facts. It was a course, Environmental Science, which we looked at the fossil fuel industry vs. the renewable energy and the problem of burning fossil fuels as a major source of CO2! It's not just about planting trees, but how you live and what you consume! Head buried in the sand with a caveman mentality and not even smart enough to realize it.

                "Content": ">Abstract  \n>.... Here, cloud-optimized monthly aggregated climate reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts dataset indicates that from 1960 to 2023, 27.9% of the global land surface became significantly more arid, while 20.5% became significantly less arid. This indicates a shift towards drier climates, with humid, semi-humid, and semi-arid areas decreasing by 8.51, 1.45, and 0.53 million-km\u00b2, respectively, and arid and hyper-arid areas increasing by 6.34 and 4.18 million-km\u00b2, respectively. This total increase of 9.99 million km\u00b2 in arid areas represents 5.9% of the global land surface, excluding Greenland and Antarctica.   \n        \n>Results  \n>General patterns of aridity rise (1960\u20132023)  \n>The results illustrating significant changes in aridity intensity across world regions over the past 63 years are depicted in Fig. 1. The intensification of aridity has spread across practically all regions that were already arid in 1960, such as Southwest North America, the Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, the Near East, the Sahel, North Brazil, and Central Asia. Central Africa has emerged as a hotspot for aridity increase, while some previously wet areas, such as the southeastern United States, have become more humid. The real increase is arid (+6.34), hyper-arid (+4.18) and semiarid (\u22120.5), in total a net balance of 9.99 more million km^2 from 1960 to 2023, which is a surface area similar to that of Canada.  \n          \n>Methods  \n>The study area encompassed six continents, excluding Antarctica, the North Pole, Greenland, and neighboring islands, totaling 1,450,532 sample points."

                "Content": "I live in Ottawa. We have the Worlds Largest Skating rink. It brings tourists and provides a pleasant winter activity for the local residents. The Rideau Canal Skateway was created in the winter of 1970-1971.  That was also the year with the longest skating season ever with 95 days. In the winter of 2022/2023, the skateway didn't open at all for the first time ever. It varies from year to year, but it has gradually gotten shorter over the years. In 2023/2024, it was open for 10 days, but only because they changed the standards for ice thickness. Otherwise it would have been open for only 5 days or so. They are brainstorming ways to extend the season. They are going to try a light weight robotic snow plow. Snow insulates the ice, slowing down freezing. They can't put their equipment on the ice until it is fairly thick. The robotic system can go on much thinner ice, clearing away the snow and hopefully extending the season by up to another 7 days. In short, climate change is destroying a major winter tourist attraction and a source of winter pleasure for the local population."

Entomology: as you\u2019re probably aware a significant portion of disease is vectored via insects. Whether that is human disease, plant disease, etc or virus, bacteria, etc insects are often the vector. And the lifecycles and migration patterns of those insects are significantly altered by minute changes in temperature which can lead to the explosion of tropical and sub tropical diseases in \u201cnon tropical\u201d regions.\nAs an example take malaria appearing at epedmic levels in the Kenyan highlands at elevations above 4000 ft msl. This change is not due to changes in malaria but rather optimal conditions for the mosquitos which vector it; blue tongue disease in livestock in Norway. This is due to international commerce but then again animal trade has been going on for centuries. The better question is why are biting midges (a tropical species) thriving in motherfucking Norway!\nI can list more examples on this if you like but here is one that carries over to my second point below\u2026\nPine beetles from eastern Canada appearing in the western us forests and decimating them\u2026but wait you say pine beetles from Canada would not benefit from increased temps. That is true but they are isolated species traditionally and the pine trees in those regions have evolved to tolerate them sans mortality. When temperatures increase mountain ranges which were traditional barriers to expansion becomes highways for expansion and the beetles move to other regions and infest stands not evolved to tolerate them. The result is widespread stand death.\n\n2.) combine things like the pine beetle with less snowpack, and centuries of clear cutting without replanting, and increases temps and you have a recipe for severe wildfire.\nMany people miss this about the California fires. 80 percent or so start on federal lands where the stands are either dead pine trees due to pine borers or overgrown final stages of fire ecology species like madrone, digger pine, or manzanita. Essentially when they clearcut there was no federal laws mandating replanting the same species. What comes up instead is the fire prone species I mentioned. Combine that with non maintained power lines due to a bankrupt utility provide (pg and e) made bankrupt because of Ken Lay and Enron and republicans trying to get Gray Davis (a combat vet who was undoubtedly going to unseat George bush in 2004) to look bad because of their energy deregulation efforts. Not to get political but I\u2019m going to get political. Fuck republicans and what they\u2019ve done to the environment. And most of all fuck Trump!"

                "Content": "> Nonetheless, the outlook for the climate is improving. In 2015 the \u201cEmissions Gap Report\u201d the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) produces before every climate summit projected that, on the basis of policies then in force around the world, global average temperatures would be almost 5\u00b0C higher than in pre-industrial times by the end of the century. This year\u2019s report puts that number at just over 3\u00b0C. Other forecasters are even more optimistic: the IEA reckons current policies will yield around 2.4\u00b0C of warming. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), a research outfit, thinks existing policies and the falling prices of green technologies will lead to 2.6\u00b0C of warming by 2050. Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, is forecasting 2.5\u00b0C by 2100 as its base case.\n\nthere is no reason to think we're currently on a path for less than 3-4C on today's emission levels alone. and that amount of warming will trigger enough feedbacks to send us much higher, to basically whatever limit is possible with natural feedbacks... an ultimate result +8C, +10C, +12C or worse is all but guaranteed in few centuries. \n\nthere no reason to expect out current rates to slow, we're talking about at least 2.5C by 2100, but in all likelihood rates will increase. net zero 2050 is basically a joke in terms of meaningful long term impact.\n\nnot only do we need to a system to stop warming directly, we'll need to be ultimately net negative at rates higher than our current emissions levels."

Often invisible to the naked eye, these tiny invertebrates form the hidden backbone of ocean ecosystems. Everything from the smallest fish to the biggest whale depends on them for sustenance.\nAsk your climate questions. With the help of generative Al, we'll try to deliver answers based on our published reporting.\n\nYet these tiny organisms \u2014 called plankton \u2014 may be unable to thrive in the rapidly warming oceans, according to a pair of new studies. The decline of these microscopic creatures puts huge portions of marine life at risk in the coming decades if nothing is done to curb human-caused climate change.\n\n\u201cIf the small things disappear, the food disappears \u2014 for the small fish, and then for the bigger fish, for the marine mammals and for us,\u201d said Daniela Schmidt, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol in England who co-wrote one of the two papers published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nEach of the two studies takes a different approach, but they come to the same startling conclusion: Plankton, many of which form the base of marine food chains, are under siege. The research punctuates one of the many ways oceans are increasingly under assault, with potentially dire consequences for humans who rely on the seas for food.\n\ud83c\udf31\n\nFollowing Climate & environment\n\nAny drop in plankton levels will have \u201ccascading effects through marine ecosystems,\u201d said Kerrie Swadling, an ecologist at the University of Tasmania who was not involved in the research.\nA \u2018very huge, very fast\u2019 change\n\nTo assess future impacts of warming waters on plankton, Schmidt and her colleagues turned to ancient changes. The team analyzed an extensive fossil record of a type of plankton called foraminifera, which leave behind tiny shells that fall to the seafloor when they die.\nA foraminifera floats close to the surface of the ocean. (Bernat Heszler/University of Bristol)\n\nWhile many plankton acclimated to the increase in temperature from the height of the last ice age 20,000 years ago to today, plankton will decline in biomass by more than 10 percent if the world warms by 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, researchers found.\n\nIt\u2019s a rate of warming that researchers say the plankton simply cannot withstand. \u201cThe last deglaciation took several thousand years,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThe same degree of warming is now happening over 100 years.\u201d\n\nThe decline in plankton is already underway.\n\nIn the second study in Nature, plankton ecologist Sonia Chaabane and her colleagues combed through eight decades\u2019 worth of data on plankton collected with nets, traps and other instruments around the world.\n\nScrutinizing nearly 200,000 samples, the team found the abundance of foraminifera has already dropped by nearly a quarter since the 1940s, with many species migrating away from the equator and deeper in the water column to survive.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure that the migration would be enough for them,\u201d Chaabane said. \u201cThe change is very, very huge, very fast \u2014 and it will continue being fast, we think,\u201d she added.\n\nMichal Kucera, a micropaleontologist at the University of Bremen who was not involved in the two papers, noted there are lots of challenges to understanding plankton. Foraminifera, for instance, are only one type of plankton, and the researchers\u2019 methods for collecting them have changed over time.\n\nStill, he said the results should be taken seriously. \u201cNo matter where and how we look, the plankton of today is already not what it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\u2018It\u2019d just be brutal\u2019\n\nClimate change threatens plankton in a few different ways. Warming stifles ocean circulation that bring nutrients from the deep to the surface. The accumulation of carbon dioxide dissolved in water renders oceans more acidic, making it harder for foraminifera to build their shells.\n\nUnlike sharks or squids, plankton cannot propel themselves through the water, making migration to cooler habitats difficult. \u201cThey can float,\u201d Chaabane said, \u201cbut they cannot swim against the currents.\u201d\nAn enlarged 3D model of a marine plankton specimen. (Daniela Schmidt/University of Bristol)\n\nJust a 10 percent drop in plankton could cause a domino effect leading to declines in populations in fish and other larger sea creatures down the food chain, according to Schmidt. \u201cIt\u2019d just be brutal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds little, 10 percent. But it is a vast change.\u201d\n\nWhile seafood is a luxury in many places, she added, \u201cthere are some parts of the world where the food from the ocean is the primary source of protein.\u201d\n\nEven for those who forgo eating fish, plankton are crucial for preventing climate change from getting even worse than it is. When foraminifera form their shells, they bind carbon with calcium to make their building material. After they die, the shells fall to the seafloor, locking that carbon out of the atmosphere for eons.\n\nPlankton are hardly the only marine creatures at risk. Over 40 percent of reef-building corals are at risk of going extinct, according to a report also released Wednesday by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nAs temperatures rise, coral fade to a ghostly white after expelling symbiotic algae that provide them food. Reefs from Fiji to the Florida Keys were recently devastated by a vast global bleaching event.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t run away,\u201d said Beth Polidoro, an Arizona State University conservation scientist who coordinated the work on coral. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck to the ground.\u201d\n\nThe flurry of research on marine life comes as diplomats meet this month in Azerbaijan at a U.N. climate summit. The talks are meant to keep nations on track to holding temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Countries can stall warming by reducing greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nBut right now the world is well shy of reaching that goal.\n\n\u201cLimiting emissions is really the only way that we can overturn warming,\u201d Swadling said.\""

In this guest essay, the author Porter Fox explains why nightmare hurricanes \u2014 such as Helene and Milton \u2014 are the new reality: \n\n\"If you are reading this in the Midwest, Northeast or even Southwest, consider that this meteorological nightmare might come for you,\" writes Porter. \"A recent study by the First Street Foundation, a research firm that studies climate threats to housing, showed that hurricanes will penetrate farther inland in decades to come, affecting states with tropical storm conditions as far west as Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin. In North Carolina, the damage from Hurricane Helene nearly 500 miles from the coast far outweighed that of the landfall site in Florida.\"\n\nRead the rest of the essay\u00a0[here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/opinion/hurricane-milton-florida-storm-surge-climate-change.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Q04.Or5e.pNjFgFo0t4Hq&smid=re-nytopinion), without a subscription to The New York Times."

The problem is that the sea level rise projections in AR6 are ridiculously low compared to what we can be absolutely certain is going to happen - based on trivial projections of the accurate satellite measurements. And [AR7 is going to published in late 2029](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar7/), therefore we are stuck with everybody being given false information for the next 5 years. I think, with extremely detailed and technical reading of AR6, that it does say the sea level rise numbers exclude various sources of sea level rise. But as published, for normal readers, AR6 is misleading. \n\n\nHere are the AR6 numbers. I have marked in bold any number above 0.7 meters. I consider anything below 0.7 meters to be nonsense because it contradicts the absolute minimum we can possibly expect based on the satellite measurements. This gives only two plausible scenarios - both require us to follow SSP5-8.5 - the highest-emissions scenario. Therefore AR6 is telling us we should only look at the highest emission scenarios for plausible climate change predictions.\n\n\n| Meters of Sea Level Rise by 2100 | *SSP1-1.9* | *SSP1-2.6* | *SSP2-4.5* | *SSP3-7.0* | SSP5-8.5 | *SSP1-2.6 Low Confidence* | SSP5-8.5 Low Confidence |\n|----:|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| High Estimate (83rd percentile) | 0.55 | 0.61 | **0.76** | **0.90** | **1.01** | **0.79** | **1.60** |\n| Median                          | 0.38 | 0.44 | 0.56 | 0.68 | **0.77** | 0.45 | **0.88** |\n| Low Estimate (17th percentile)  | 0.28 | 0.32 | 0.43 | 0.55 | 0.63 | 0.32 | 0.63 |"

Sea level rise is just one variable. The idea that the other RCPs have wrong sea level rise and so we should use RCP8.5 to predict extinctions doesn't make sense to me. Of all the reasons climate change will cause species extinctions, sea level rise is very low on the list imo. Habitat loss from changes in variables such as temperature and precipitation is likely going to cause as much or more habitat loss than sea level rise. I'd much rather be right about those and wrong about sea level rise than the reverse. Sea level rise would also benefit marine species.\n\nIf your argument is that everything below 8.5 has bad sea level rise info and therefore everything else has to be wrong, I don't know if I agree with that. If your argument is that sea level rise is extremely important for extinction, I don't really agree with that either.

Lawyer, banker, architect, medic, engineer, artist, writer, geographer, satellite designer, anthropologist, chemist, philosopher. I know people in all of those jobs, and more, who are working on tackling climate change.\n\nDoing a specialist Masters in one of the areas that you're good at, can be a good way to get onto the right path, but that will depend very much on what the economy is like in the place you want to live: in Ireland, Britain, and much of the rest of Western Europe, I'd definitely recommend a Masters. I don't know about the rest of the world.\n\nEngineering has lots of potential uses, if you want to return to that, and it'd depend whether you see yourself more in electrics, electronics, civil, mechanical; but there are climate opportunities in each of those."

So, I won\u2019t give any specific ideas that are only relevant to engineers. We need all kinds of people involved in this effort.\n\nFew things that come to mind immediately:\n\n1. Education about climate change at all levels from early childhood to adults. There are many subcategories here that range from how to make a difference as an individual, how to create sustainable practices at a community level, how to bring better practices to produce food, energy, transportation, and education on the need for conscious consumption etc. Everything has an aspect of education because climate change is fundamentally a problem of lack of education and greed that leads to mindless consumption without regard for the planet.\n\n2. Solutions to reduce dairy and meat consumption around the world. This is the second biggest contributor to carbon emissions worldwide due to massive deforestation, biodiversity loss, methane production, etc. \n\n3. Influencing policy changes around green taxes for all goods and finding and developing alternatives for high footprint goods that don\u2019t have good alternatives - like transportation, energy, plastic.\n\n4. Doing research on climate change and helping provide evidence and tracking of interventions and policies. \n\n\u2026I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more. But researching what others are doing in these areas would be a good starting point."

It's how climate change increased the available energy in the atmosphere that made this event more likely and more extreme. \n\nClimate change increased the chances of the recent low pressure in the Pacific.  It was comparable to a category 4 hurricane.  Those events are getting more common and more extreme, so the chinooks are getting more extreme. \n\nThe jet stream is also seemingly more unstable.  So big, deep, cold troughs are getting more common.\n\nTyphoons have happened for millenia, but having 4 big typoons pummel the same area in 2 weeks is not normal.  Having big rain events around the globe is normal, but getting multiple 500mm rain events and 1000-year storms in a single season is not.\n\nThere will still be extreme cold spells.  That doesn't mean climate change isn't real.  More heat energy in the atmosphere impacts everything about the weather."

It is not an unprecedented or atypical feature of Alberta's climate for temperatures to occasionally get this warm, or even warmer, on an occasional basis during the winter. \n\nHowever, these stretches of mild weather are becoming more persistent and insistent than usual as the climate warms, and contrasted more dramatically with cold spells due to an increasingly wobbly jet stream, especially during the colder seasons. It's not unusual for it to be 8\\*C every now and then during a mild spell, but for this weather to last for all of December like it did last year, definitely is not typical and due to changing climate patterns."

Large glaciers suppressed earthquakes, but according to a study published in 2008 in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, as the Earth rebounds, the downward pressure on the plates is released and shaky pre-existing faults could reactivate. In Southeast Alaska, where uplift is most prevalent, the Pacific plate slides under the North American plate, causing a lot of strain. Researchers say that glaciers had previously quelled that strain, but the rebound is allowing those plates to grind up against each other again. \u201cThe burden of the glaciers was keeping smaller earthquakes from releasing tectonic stress,\u201d says Erik Ivins, a geophysicist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory."

Suppose that 50% of the time you alleviate stress and the other 50% of the time you increase stress.  If the original stress would have caused a crack then the thing would have already broken.  The odds of something breaking during a short time period are much higher if stress is changing.  I am very confident that at least *some* volcanoes will *not* erupt next year.  \n\nAlso consider what happens when you poke a balloon.  It does not matter if you poke from inside or out.  It pops either way.  The rubber is stressed from gas pressure.  The act of poking it alleviates pressure in some parts of the ballon material."

Currently the weight of their ice sheet is creating downward pressure on the landmass, and thus the earth\u2019s mantle below it.  To my mind, this increased pressure on the mantle likely increases volcanic activity on Iceland and the retreat of the glaciers and subsequent runoff of glacial melt would reduce that pressure, and thus also reduce volcanic activity.  Any vulcanologists wanna chime in?"

                "Content": ">...Some 30 miles from Sapporo, the Hokkaido Electric Power Network (HEPCO Network) is deploying flow batteries, an emerging kind of battery that stores energy in hulking tanks of metallic liquid.  \n         \n>But the technology faces a raft of challenges, including high up-front costs and skeptical financiers. China and Russia dominate the market for vanadium, the metal that makes flow batteries durable and easy to maintain. \u201cThe supply chain for vanadium is extremely precarious,\u201d said Kara Rodby, a battery analyst at the investment firm Volta Energy Technologies.  \n            \n>Still, flow batteries are making their debut in big real-world projects. Sumitomo Electric, the company that built the Hokkaido plant, has also built flow batteries in [Taiwan, Belgium, Australia, Morocco and California](https://sumitomoelectric.com/products/redox/cases?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://sumitomoelectric.com/products/redox/cases?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\"). Hokkaido\u2019s flow battery farm was the biggest in the world when it opened in April 2022 \u2014 a record that lasted just a month before China built one that is [eight times bigger](https://www.energy-storage.news/first-phase-of-800mwh-world-biggest-flow-battery-commissioned-in-china/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://www.energy-storage.news/first-phase-of-800mwh-world-biggest-flow-battery-commissioned-in-china/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\") and can deliver as much energy as [an average U.S. natural gas plant](https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/power-plants-average-capacities/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/power-plants-average-capacities/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\").     \n           \n>Inside a sprawling two-story warehouse, HEPCO Network is storing electricity in 130 gleaming steel and plastic tanks. They can stockpile enough energy to power more than 27,000 Japanese homes for four hours.  \n     \n>Each 10,000-gallon tank holds tiny particles of the metal vanadium, which float around in water. This metallic soup holds the key to hoarding energy in massive quantities.  \n         \n>Vanadium is a shape-shifter. If you add or remove electrons from its atoms the element\u2019s electrical charge will become more positive or negative, and its color changes from purple to green, blue and yellow. The metal\u2019s rainbow color palette led Swedish chemist Nils Gabriel Sefstrom to [name the element after Vanadis](https://www.britannica.com/science/vanadium?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://www.britannica.com/science/vanadium?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\"),  the Scandinavian goddess of beauty. But vanadium\u2019s ability to change its charge is what makes it so useful in a battery.   \n        \n>One major barrier to building more of these battery farms is finding enough vanadium. Three-quarters of the world\u2019s supply comes as a by-product from 10 steel mills in China and Russia, according to Rodby, who got her PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying the [design and market for flow batteries](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/145016/Rodby-krodby-phd-chemE-2022-thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y&itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/145016/Rodby-krodby-phd-chemE-2022-thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y&itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\"). Australia, South Africa and the United States also produce vanadium, but in much smaller quantities.     \n       \n>[Mines that have been proposed](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/first-us-primary-vanadium-mine-approved-2023-10-30?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://www.miningweekly.com/article/first-us-primary-vanadium-mine-approved-2023-10-30?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\") could [boost supply](https://www.australianvanadium.com.au/our-assets/the-australian-vanadium-project/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://www.australianvanadium.com.au/our-assets/the-australian-vanadium-project/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\"). And [some flow battery start-ups](https://elestor.com/technology?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template \"https://elestor.com/technology?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\") are trying to sidestep the vanadium problem entirely by using different materials that are easier to buy.   \n        \n>The other hurdle is their up-front cost. Vanadium flow batteries are at least twice as expensive to build as lithium-ion batteries, Rodby said, and banks are hesitant to lend money to fund an unfamiliar technology.  \n       \n>But experts say flow batteries can be cheaper in the long run because they\u2019re easier to maintain and last longer. A lithium-ion battery might have to be replaced after 10 years, but Rodby says flow batteries can last much longer. \u201cThere really is no finite lifetime for a flow battery in the way there is for lithium-ion,\u201d Rodby said.   \n       \n>Sumitomo Electric President Osamu Inoue said his company guarantees its flow batteries will last 20 years \u2014 but the vanadium inside can be reused forever in future batteries. The company\u2019s oldest commercial batteries have been running for 11 years so far.  \n         \n>Experts say the world will need to build many more batteries like these to stay on track to cut greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050. Over the next six years, utilities will have to build 35 times as many batteries as there are today to soak up all extra renewable energy that will come online, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nSource of link to the WP article: Carbon Brief [Daily Briefing](https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/japan-eyes-cutting-emissions-by-60-by-2035-from-2013-levels/ \"https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/japan-eyes-cutting-emissions-by-60-by-2035-from-2013-levels/\") \u2014 November 27, 2024 > WP [These batteries could harness the wind and sun to replace coal and...](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2024/flow-batteries-renewable-energy-storage/ \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2024/flow-batteries-renewable-energy-storage/\")."

EXPONENTIAL.\n\n  \nThis is the minor detail kind of shit that armchair scientists (including me, to some extent) tend to miss. \n\nThe second thing people miss is when one thing \"breaks\", there can often be \"collateral damage\". Follow Nascar? NO? I used to love Nascar. If you have a tire going down, you get off RIGHT AWAY, because if it blows you are OUT of the race. NOT because of the tire, which is easy to fix ... but because if it blows at 150 mph it also SHREDS the fender - and THAT is not easy to fix. A drought isn't really a big deal UNLESS ... that drought causes a wildfire that burns 500 square miles of forest. THAT becomes a big deal to more than JUST the people who lived in that area. And that's because the drought happened in an area that didn't used to have BIG droughts so it didn't used to have BIG FIRES. And the fires that did happen got put out by rain, that isn't happening anymore.\n\nThe drought fixes itself next year maybe. The forest that burned? Not so much ..."

                "Content": "Respectfully disagree. I work in climate risk (and used to be a geologist) and one of my clients is a major UK supermarket. A few months ago they were discussing collapse of the food system because of how much difficulty they're having in procuring fresh food. The UK had a wet winter and a crap summer, leading to the second worst harvest on record, and 2/3 of UK food is imported, mostly from Spain and Portugal and mostly from localised regions, which have been affected by drought and now terrible flooding in the last few weeks. If a supermarket is discussing this in terms of operational difficulties now, I don't think we should be considering 2050 as not much of a difference. Issues like this won't be discussed widely because it's bad for business and share prices and so most people only know about it when they see empty shelves, which has happened in my local supermarket quite often this year in the fruit and veg section. It's not all about temperature and I wouldn't assume we're safe before 2050 from the ill effects of climate change."

These titles are from both my read and to-be-read piles, so I can't fully vouch for every last one, and they may be varying degrees of what you personally consider sci-fi, but all have the devastating effects of BAU climate front and center:\n\n\n*The Ministry for the Future* by Kim Stanley Robinson\u00a0\n\n\n*The Deluge* by Stephen Markley\u00a0\n\n\n*The Great Transition* by Nick Googins\u00a0\n\n\n*The Lost Cause* by Cory Doctorow (lots of his stuff features climate change even if it focuses more on the apocalyptic effects of unrestrained techbros. Honorable Mentions to *Walkaway* and *Radicalized*. His *Martin Hench* books are also great fun.)\n\n\n*Saturation Point* by Adrian Tchaikovsky\n\n\n*Everyone In Silico* by Jim Munroe\n\n\n*American War* by Omar El Akkad\n\n\n*The Sleepless* by Victor Manibo\n\n\n*Gamechanger* and *Dealbreaker* by LX Beckett\n\n\n*Star's Reach* and *Retrotopia* by John Michael Greer\u00a0\n\n\n*Hum* by Helen Phillips\n\n\n*Arboreality* by Rebecca Campbell\n\n\n*Bannerless* by Carrie Vaughn\n\n\n*Appleseed* by Matt Bell\n\n\n*Contingency Plans for the Apocalypse and Other Possible Situations* by SB Divya\u00a0\n\n\n*The Free People's Village* by Sim Kern seems to be at least half about how we could have avoided all of this for want of a fully detached chad in Florida...\n\n\n*Walk the Vanished Earth* by Erin Swan\n\n\n*Thrust* by Lidia Yuknavitch\n\n\n*Firewalker* by Adrian Tchaikovsky\n\n\n*This Won\u2019t Help: Modest Proposals for a More Enjoyable Apocalypse* by Eli Grober.

The trilogy is called *Science in the Capitol* and was explicitly written to try and get through some thick skulls.\u00a0\n\n\n*And Lately, the Sun: Speculative Fictions for a Climate-Thrashed World* put together by the Calyx Create Group\n\n\n*New York 2140* by Kim Stanley Robinson. This man is *trying his best* to make people see.\n\n\n*A Half-Built Garden* by Ruthanna Emrys\n\n\n*The Drowned World* by JG Ballard was published in the deeply distressing year of *nineteen-hundred-and-sixty-two.*\n\n\n*The Sheep Look Up* by John Brunner is another distressingly old cli-fi title, from 1972.\n\n\n....and I think that's about all I can get down at the moment, it's bedtime for the kiddos and I'm needed elsewhere.

                "Content": "This is a logical fallacy - the Tu Quoque fallacy - and it is a deflection, not an argument.  It\u2019s a version of ad hominem - attacking the messenger rather than the message.  Strong arguments do not depend on the reputation of the arguer - and bluntly, climate change is an incredibly strong argument. \n\nHowever, in classical rhetoric, \u201ctoo much\u201d hypocrisy affects one\u2019s ethos: whether one is perceived as trustworthy. And this affects how one\u2019s arguments are perceived: people frequently don\u2019t examine the actual evidence of arguments, but instead rely on heuristics. These cognitive biases distort thinking - but are so common that some people embrace them as \u201ccommon sense\u201d when really they are nonsensical. \n\nOur entire economy and society is based on overuse of carbon, so yeah, it\u2019s not possible to remove oneself  from it, and most changes require a lot of work on the part of the individual. Doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t work towards it. I do think making sacrifices towards the goal helps - even though it\u2019s not necessary for one\u2019s argument to be valid, it demonstrates that you take it seriously.  And since the ultimate aim is not to win an argument but to reduce atmospheric carbon, this action contributes to the final goal. \n\nBut someone who commits to the tu quoque fallacy isn\u2019t actually interested in the argument itself.  I find it helpful to recognize they don\u2019t really care and will continue to move the goalposts of what is fair (i.e., non-hypocritical) no matter what I do. So instead I think about who I really want to reach - people who actually do care about evidence and who may not have access/exposure to it. And I concentrate my efforts there. \n\nTL/DR: some people aren\u2019t interested in evidence but instead play gotcha games and whataboutism. These people are often jerks and/or idiots and you should probably put your energy elsewhere."

For web sources, this encyclopedia is useful: [https://rhetoric.byu.edu](https://rhetoric.byu.edu) . If you like logical fallacies, the Fallacy Files are fun to peruse: [https://www.fallacyfiles.org](https://www.fallacyfiles.org)  Once you have the hang of them, it\u2019s fun to play \u201cspot the fallacy\u201d in watching the news, reading reddit, etc. \n\nBut this PDF of a small booklet is excellent - I\u2019ve actually used this as a textbook a few years ago (I teach writing, and rhetoric is part of that). The Essential Guide to Rhetoric by Keith and Lindbergh (2008): [http://www.joycerain.com/uploads/2/3/2/0/23207256/essential\\_guide\\_to\\_rhetoric.pdf](http://www.joycerain.com/uploads/2/3/2/0/23207256/essential_guide_to_rhetoric.pdf) \n\nLots of neat stuff on environmental rhetoric too - it can get specialized, but almost any book on environmental communication will address this. \n\nGood luck!"

Here's one approach I\u2019ve found helpful when sharing the importance of sustainability:\n\nAcknowledge your own imperfection: You could start by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m definitely not perfect, and I\u2019m not claiming to be.\u201d This shows humility and lets them know you\u2019re on the same side in terms of trying to live better.\n\nShift the focus to collective responsibility: You could then say, \u201cBut I believe that even small changes can add up when we all take responsibility. It\u2019s not about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about progress. Imagine if each of us made one change. Together, that could have a huge impact.\u201d\n\nHighlight shared values: Emphasize shared values you both care about, like health, family, or future generations. For example, \u201cI know we both want a healthy planet for the kids/grandkids. Even small adjustments in how we live today can help protect what we love in the long run.\u201d\n\nSometimes, people deflect to avoid uncomfortable topics or feel defensive, so keeping the conversation collaborative and empathetic can help them see that it\u2019s not about criticism, but about inspiring positive change\u2014no matter where each of us is on our journey."

                "Content": "It\u2019s a sign of high emotional state. \n\nThe quick and dirty reason is that others can feel attacked. So they put up impossible standards as a barrier to protect themselves. You first have to get them to relax their defensive posture. \n\nOne thing you can try is \u201cecho and downshift\u201d. Any time a person becomes emotionally charged it\u2019s important to give them some space. So when someone accuses you of being imperfect, you can respond by repeating what they say, \u201cyou think I\u2019m imperfect\u201d.\n\nThey may respond with \u201cthat\u2019s what I said.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I just wanted to make sure I understood.\u201d\n\nThey may add on or go silent or have some other reaction, but it\u2019s about deescalating the emotions first. Sometime you can even see the person backtrack their words and take back what they said after they have calmed down on their own a little. \n\nThe hard part is managing your emotions and staying neutral. We can get defensive too when they make claims against us, but it\u2019s important to remember that what we feel is our responsibility and not something we should let others try to manipulate. Their reaction is not something you can always control, but you can regulate yourself with various techniques. \n\nIf you are interested I recommend Bren\u00e9 Brown or \u201cTherapy In A Nutshell\u201d on YouTube. \n\nWe have a lot of problems trying to communicate with each other. Much of it can be traced back to emotionally charged information. Emotion is how we get manipulated into many things and we live in a time when emotions aren\u2019t really taught or well understood which makes all of us fairly easy targets. Hold what is yours and try to avoid taking responsibility for what other people think or feel. It\u2019s not up to you, but that also doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad to care about people. \n\nIt\u2019s the difference between caring and carrying. Be empathetic not domineering."

That's a very ambitious (to the point of being unrealistic) goal, but we're trying to put our best foot forward here. Now, goals are only important if we actually try to hit them and so politicians and journalists and activists have tried to emphasize the importance of striving for this goal. But in doing so, a lot of people have been given the false impression that something bad is expected to happen in that specific year that we are trying to divert. This just isn't the case. \n\n\nThe 2050 net zero goal is about limiting the temperature that we will reach by 2100. It is not about preventing some sudden apocalypse in 2050.\n\n\nThe numbers that journalists and activists often talk about (ie. 2050, 2100, 1.5\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C). These numbers are so suspiciously round and nice, because they are numbers pulled from our climate GOALS and TARGETS. These are numbers that humans have selected specifically because they are round and memorable. These are not the years/temperatures at which something bad is suddenly going to happen. \n\n\n1.5\u00b0C will certainly be worse than the 1.3\u00b0C that we are currently experiencing and 2\u00b0C will be even worse than that, but that's just a matter of bigger temperature increases being worse. It's not a matter of 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C being magic numbers.\n\n\n2100 is just the year that scientists tend to use for predictions, because it is helpful for comparison if all predictions use the same year and it is sufficiently far away for small changes to add up to observable effects. \n\n\nIf we want to influence the temperature that we reach in 2100, then it's no good reducing emissions in 2095. We need to reduce emissions as soon as possible. But this is also a big problem that can't be solved overnight. So 2050 has become the target year for many countries. Nice and round. In the middle of now and the predictions year. Some countries aim for 2060 (like India), some countries aim for 2040. The world (via the Paris agreement) is collectively aiming for 2050."

Green energy, regenerative farming, new non toxic materials, transport methods, and such things are the only way out. I would argue that the fossil fuel industry and petrochemical industry are actually holding us in the past by maintaining their business model from 100 years ago. We need much more of everything, not less, but clean. We need abundant clean energy to power the tech revolution. We need abundant healthy food to feed the growing populations."

                "Content": "Ultimately you'll have to make the case that Bjorn isn't just speaking facts. He's calling on specific facts that back up his point while gagging the others that would prove inconvenient. You could approach this one of two ways: character attacks or the Socratic method. The first involves pointing out that the facts don't speak for themselves, they're called on by the historian, writer, etc. when useful and the other, perhaps contradictory facts, sit quietly. Bjorn is, primarily, interested in promoting a narrative for the purposes not of informing people of a topic but by garnering attention for going against the consensus. He is not an honest actor, because he doesn't give you the whole picture. Instead, he's a shill for industry and/or political operatives.\n\nThe second method is more involved, basically, it involves starting with treating Bjorn's positions as true then asking about them and proposing other alternatives by bringing in outside knowledge, facts, figures, etc. You could take a step back and ask a more general question, \"Why do you believe Bjorn but not published climate scientists? Is there maybe some priors and biases at play here that Bjorn is using to trick you into believing something that isn't true?\"\n\nThe truth is, your grandfather probably isn't going to change his mind. He's not equipped to dig into scientific research so he'll just find someone who agrees with his political beliefs and accept them as trusting. It's okay to point this out, but it'll likely make him angry because Americans are typically of the belief all opinions are created equal--they are not."

Bjorn is reacting to a made up strawman position that the world is ending by the end of this century or significantly less. If you state that climate change is one of the most significant issues facing humanity and we aren't taking action quickly enough Bjorn is completely irrelevant.\n\nIt's just click bait/algorithm dribble.\n\nLet's go through them though.\n\n>**Myth 1. \u201cSmall islands are doomed by rising sea levels\u201d**\n\nI don't know if this is true or not. It also has nothing to do with climate change being real or not. It's just cherry picking some random fact. I think he does this to avoid the big picture.\n\nSea levels are definitely rising.\n\n[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sea-level](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sea-level)\n\n>**Myth 2: \u201cExtreme weather events are killing more people\u201d**\n\nThis is true but it doesn't prove climate change isn't real. It's just so far we haven't been hugely impacted by extreme weather events in terms of loss of life. My opinion backed up by the data (check our wold in data) is that extreme weather events have so far not increased significantly. This does not mean they won't increase significantly in the future.\n\n>**Myth 3: \u201cClimate lockdowns are a good solution\u201d**\u00a0\n\nI have no idea what this has to do with climate change. I think again it's an appeal to culture war warriors.\n\n>**Myth 4: \u201cElectric cars don\u2019t harm the environment\u201d**\n\nThis is the classic strawman argument. The reality is that electric cars are required to help us counter climate change by reducing emissions.\n\n>**Myth 5: \u201cPolar bears are going extinct on melting ice caps\u201d**\n\nI don't know if this is true or not. It also has nothing to do with climate change being real or not. It's just cherry picking some random fact.

And the ONLY way you are going to attract their attention is by injecting your podcast with a little <ahem> \"controversial content,\" so that climate-deniers think that you might be giving \"their side\" a voice. Then they would indeed be more inclined to at least listen to the actual real climate science.\n\nBut the problem with that is that you actually WOULD be voicing the very same disinformation your podcast is trying to fight.\n\nThat said, though, I am by no means trying to discourage you from doing the podcast, and getting getting expert opinions on the show. A fair amount of misleading info gets mixed into the actually legit info that people who are aware of climate change will absorb. So at least you'll be helping to correct the record _for them,_ and as an audience they'll be highly receptive to listening."

We\u2019re getting more intense downpours, so more landslides. \n\nThe nice thing is, when we make these improvements, we can also improve things like energy efficiency and water conservation. I worked on a project that moved the water sources for three towns to areas away from landslide slopes, and at the same time, we put in state of the art leak monitoring systems and hydroelectric power, so the systems power themselves and conserve 40% more water. And residents love it because that lowers their water bills."

That has become such a rare event nowadays that, when it happens, it is considered catastrophic.\n\nMy mum still has her old geography book, printed in the 1950s, where our region was described as \"heat days with temperatures above 25C extremely rare\" (3-5 days per year).

November has been warm and dry this year, which has been terrifying. White and snowy Christmases are becoming rarer, it doesn't get really snowy and cold until January-March.

We just lived through a thousand year flood that has been classified as a geological event now. Rivers went from a foot or two to 26-30 feet high. Whole towns have been wiped out. Over 2000 huge landslides. 822,000 acres of trees have been damaged or wiped put. Our infrastructure was destroyed. We still don\u2019t have drinking water, it\u2019s been 6 weeks so far. \n\nThe rivers have moved. The land has moved. \n\nOur local economy is now crumbling since we rely on tourism, but especially at this specific point every year when the leaf lookers arrive. Business are failing every day and thousands have lost jobs. I don\u2019t know if my business will make it. \n\nA hurricane in the mountains of Western North Carolina is the equivalent of a blizzard in Miami. We don\u2019t get hurricanes in the mountains. We don\u2019t have flooding like this. Many of us moved here since it was a \u201csafe place\u201d.

Insect-borne diseases don't require a terribly warm climate, just warm enough that freezes are rare since a single freeze will kill them off to halt the spread.  South Florida, Gulf Coast, and Mediterranean regions used to have endemic diseases like Malaria.\n\nA major killer of old was Yellow Fever.  It exists only in humans, but is spread by mosquito.  An infected individual would arrive in a city, even inland on the Ohio River, and tens of thousands would die.  A doctor in Havana identified the culprit in Malaria and Yellow Fever, even the exact species of mosquito in both and fixed it.  Mainland doctors shunned him as a crackpot, but the head of the U.S. Panama Canal project trusted him and funded him, which allowed a great drop in deaths and completion of the Canal.  Yellow Fever (plus bad design) had caused the French failure, killing about 70% of French engineers sent there, and even many of the laborers from Barbados who had some immunity from their African ancestry."

Otherwise, people who live on and near the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastlines of the United States might have to get their hurricane forecasts from Trump on television with a sharpie and a map, drawing arrows to show his supporters where he wants an approaching hurricane to go. If NOAA is dismantled and commercialized, Trump can order NOAA to conceal daily, weekly and seasonal weather forecasts from the public and other investors for a few days or weeks so that Trump, his family, and friends can buy and sell options that will make them hundreds of millions in profits after a storm or hurricane wipes out a large swath of crops across a section of an agricultural belt. In that sense, a commercialized NOAA, NHC and NWS can become major centers of profit for Trump, his family, and friends, and he can sell the real forecasts to insiders willing to pay him millions of dollars in fees for weather and climate information unavailable to the general public. Whomever he appoints to head the NOAA and its divisions can receive huge annual bonuses, lucrative early retirements plans, and other underhanded benefits like in corrupt and criminal corporations on Wall Street. Beginning with Trump, NOAA eventually could become more profitable than Amazon or Apple."

The solution I'm thinking of is therefore to replace products of type A with products of type B of similar value that are currently less visible, due to market powers. \n\nLet's say the \"product\" is to travel from Vienna to COP29 in Baku. Taking the train is a long ride, many will not do it out of convenience. Flying, ordered by the lowest emissions gave me an indirect flight via Istanbul with an estimated 242 kg CO2 in a popular flight search engine. Takes seven hours, airport to airport.\n\nIn this particular case I would suggest taking the bus to Budapest Airport (3-4 hours) and flying directly to Baku. 151 kg CO2 estimated. Many would consider that option. But it doesn't show in popular engines.\n\nThat's 38% saved using the replacement technique. To recap, my suggestion is to make more sustainable options people would be likely to choose more visible."

        "Content": "There are loads of talks about how solar and wind energy alone aren't enough if we really want to move towards clean energy. Yet there's more and more chatter about building more solar and wind farms and investing in these renewable sources - while we all know we need a mix of different renewables to really make a difference. It's the same old story for everyone - the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow... yea yea... you can see it especially in the UK where wind energy drops off dramatically during the summer.\n\nI've been following CorPower Ocean's journey (https://corpowerocean.com/a-short-history-of-wave-energy/) for a while now, and I'm really chuffed about their recent big investment. While I'm glad there's more discussion about ocean energy, I really feel there's a lack of talks about tidal energy. Tidal energy is predictable and reliable, and I know some people say it's not always there, but as long as the moon and gravity exist, tides are pretty much always around - not like waves, solar, wind, etc., which depend on the weather.\n\nThere are already some great tidal energy technologies that can produce clean and, most importantly, reliable energy - like Orbital Marine Power, Nova, and my favourite one because of their seashell design and technology that's completely 3D printed and, as I understand it, much cheaper than other technologies - Spiralis Energy (https://www.spiralis.energy). Yet, they all lack investment, and more importantly, tidal energy itself isn't getting the buzz it deserves, even though it could be a really big deal.\n\nJust trying to understand the cons of tidal energy, and why the hell we don't hear more talks about it from climate change advocates, politicians, and \"big leaders.\"????? \ud83e\udd74",

Only half of these would be economically viable. As high and low tides occur every 12 hours and 24 minutes, the power cannot be supplied evenly. This problem of uneven energy generation is exacerbated by high spring tides and weak neap tides. Operation with salt water causes severe corrosion of the turbines; this means considerable maintenance costs, which in turn reduces economic efficiency.\nIn addition, tidal power plants are ecologically problematic as they affect the fauna and flora of coastal waters. Coastal ecosystems have evolved with the natural twelve-hour cycle, but behind such a tidal power plant the phases are shifted. The migration of aquatic animals into and out of the bay and into the rivers flowing into it is hindered.\nSuch tidal power plants with a dam will only be able to make a small contribution to meeting electricity demand in future due to the limited number of possible sites and the considerable ecological impact\n\n(Translated with DeepL)"

US Ocean Energy Systems wrote a huge, in-depth science report about marine renewable energy (https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/state-of-the-science-2024) - tidal energy technologies have a really small impact on marine life and ecosystems because they move reeeeeeally slowly. As for tsunamis, that could be a concern, yeah. I think the biggest issue right now with tidal energy technologies is making them easy to repair, and I believe Spiralis Energy has made some progress there with their 3D printing technology, which allows parts to be easily changed, recycled, and printed again... but it's still unclear to me how they're going to do that in the open ocean."

There are still companies working on it, and if they ever figure out how to do it at a price competitive with solar and wind, then tidal will get scaled up.\n\nBut the problem is not that people aren't aware of it. The ocean ***breaks*** things. Tidal turbines are just very expensive."

Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be just as fucked as everything else, or worse because of its extremely unique ecosystems.\n\nAsheville, NC was supposed to be a climate haven too, and look how that turned out. No one is safe from climate change, and no one can hide. Great Lakes might not get hurricanes but wild weather still is happening. These temp swings have been causing massive lake effect snow thaws and refreeze, for example. Killed 15 people over thanksgiving, and that was in a smaller town. You are just trading one danger for another.\n\nI am sure other states like Maine, Vermont, Minnesota, etc are seeing the same thing, with people running from regions they perceive as dangerous. This is going to cause massive political instability from locals clashing with refugees and lead us down the path of collapse sooner than later.\n\nMy recommendation: do NOT move to the Great lakes Region to run from climate change. Move where you want because the area has a lot to offer.\n\nClimate change is coming for everyone and everything, no where is safe."

Which is the current figure today.\n\nThe thing is, the ozone hole has healed since the 1980s, and they expect it to be back to its old self by 2050. So, it has a much shorter period where changes affect it compared to climate change. So, you can't compare the two.\n\nCFCs only took a few short decades to do the damage they did.\n\nAnd yeah, if we didn't stop using CFCs and other ozone depletants, the holes would just get bigger and bigger until there is no more ozone to react with the CFCs. Though, that would probably take a LOT of CFCs and a time span of a century or more.\n\nWithout an ozone layer, essentially everyone would be subjected to powerful short length ultraviolet that would cook our eyeballs in minutes. Eyeballs have little circulation, so heat builds up more in them. That's why microwaves give you cataracts.\n\nAnd the UV light would definitely impart a large amount of thermal radiation to anything it hits. Heck I have a flashlight that's 5 watts of UVA (365nm) and the light (not the flashlight, but the actual light itself) is warm to the touch.\n\nBesides the ionizing damage from the radiation turning your DNA into Swiss cheese especially deeper UV like UVB or UVC, which isn't even allowed through by ozone and will fuck you up bad. Some UVB gets through, but not UVC.\n\nAnd in case you're curious, yes I can absolutely get a tan from my UV flash light. I was curious, so I put my wrist in front of it for 20 minutes.\n\nI had a sunburn the size of a quarter for the next week, then a brown patch that didn't go away for 4 months. How bout that?"

They were really a chemical company, that got into cameras to sell more goods and services from their chemical business.  After digital cameras broke thru, they were only a shadow of their former self.  They could have pivoted and ended up in a slightly better position, but it would not have been the same company.  So they buried the invention, and carried on business as usual for as long as they could.  The difference is that oil companies have a global effect that will be hurting everyone for centuries to come."

The Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs was signed in 1986 i think and all countries immediately got to work putting in controls to phase out the worst of those man made gases. But then the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by increasing combustion of fossil fuels came into the spotlight and by 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol was signed the full fledged attacks on science had begun. Now we can thank those same fossil fuel companies who funded that for the escalating destruction from climate change, in fact we should sue them all to extinction for wanton negligence."

By the time of the initial international agreement in 1987 the CFC growth rate had accelerated rapidly to the point that it was contributing only a little less than CO2 to total annual GHG forcing increase and was already ~ 15% of total historical GHG forcing.\n\n\nWithout the ban CFCs would likely now contribute an additional 1W/m2 to total historical forcing. But a further matter is development of other gases for other industrial purposes which had to comply with this legislation, resulting in GHGs with lower growth potential.\n\n\nThe short story is we would definitely have blown past 1.5C by now and limiting to 2C would look like a fantasy. Currently rate of warming would be clearly beyond 0.3C/decade."

I'm genuinely not sure if the people you're talking about are confused by the phrasing or just forgot everything they learned in school on the subject.\n\nAnd 'atmospheric carbon' is the gases carbon dioxide and methane, so you can just refer to them specifically, and then you don't need to explain which carbon needs to be reduced. You can also refer to them as greenhouse gases, because they are and it's why they're a problem. If carbon dioxide in the atmosphere wasn't trapping heat, the same physics as a literal greenhouse in which plants are grown, it genuinely wouldn't be an issue."

But how exactly are rising temperatures and gun violence intertwined, and could addressing the effects of climate change in cities hold the key to curbing this alarming trend?\n\n  \nAccording to a [recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2799635?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=121622) by researchers at the University of Washington and Boston University looking at heat and shootings in 100 U.S. cities from 2015 to 2020, nearly 7% of gun violence incidents could be directly attributed to above-average seasonal temperatures. In New York City, that percentage doubles to around 15%.\n\nThat means that in New York in 2020, a pandemic year with the highest number of shooting incidents in the city\u2019s recent history, an estimated 286 shooting incidents wouldn\u2019t have occurred if it wasn\u2019t exceptionally hot outside, according to the researchers. That\u2019s one of the highest of the 100 cities studied, said [Jonathan Jay](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/jonathan-jay/), a Boston University researcher and a co-author of the paper.\n\n\u201cIn general, the Northeast and the Midwest had shown the most dramatic heat effects,\u201d Jay said.\n\nAiming to better understand how day-to-day fluctuations in temperatures affect the number of gun violence incidents, the researchers analyzed U.S. shooting data from the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) from 2015 to 2020. To more accurately demonstrate the impact of daily temperature changes, they made sure to factor in specific tendencies that take place in different seasons like holidays, more kids being out of school \u2013 what scientists call \u201cseasonality\u201d \u2013\u00a0 in their analyses.\"",

Adopting a plant-based diet. Not willingly buy industrial meat, dairy, and eggs. Though, I am gaining interest in hog hunting, as feral swine are destructive in the Southeast U.S. where I'm from, and they don't have a natural predator, but if I don't have a way of hunting game, I would remain vegetarian.\n\n3. Composting. I built two bins outside, one from a Lowe's bucket and another from a tote, also from the same store as the former.\n\n4. Growing produce at home. I grew Walmart organic bell peppers from seed with an LED light I'm using as an aquarium light for my 55 gallon freshwater aquarium. I also feed the homegrown peppers to my guinea pigs.\n\n5. Looking more into home aquaponics. Already doing that with a romaine stalk I have in one of my fish tanks. I want to eventually have all of my fish tanks (freshwater) to grow something aquaponically. I guess being an avid aquarist helps find more sustainable way to get food for not just me, but for my pet guinea pigs.\n\n6. Doing outdoor gardening as well as the aforementioned aquaponics. I got gardening gloves, shears, and a farmer's almanac for Christmas this year.\n\nHere's some of my long-term goals:\n\n1. Getting our house solar powered.\n2. Never owning a pure gas vehicle again. I'm looking to get an EV or e bike. In fact, if I remember correctly, I think they're building an EV battery factory just between Savannah and Statesboro on I-16.",

Unless I need a surgery and must take a plane to get to the hospital I will not fly again. \n\nI don't eat animal products - I see no downside to this and lots of benefits. Yes I still eat very well, at least as good or better foods than before. \n\nI don't buy anything new if I can find it second-hand. It's amazing how many hardly used, pre-owned things I have found. I try not to buy anything unnessesary. \n\nWe compost and grow some of our own food. And we have rainbarrels to collect rainwater for the garden. They hold max 2000 litres.  \n\nWe have installed a heat pump to heat the house. \n\nI don't shower every day, and we buy all kinds of soap as bars so less plastic waste. \n\nWe recycle bottles, metall, plastic, glass, and paper. There is very little left as garbage.  \n\nNext year we think our car will have to be scrapped, and we will buy a new-for-us EV. (Not Tesla)  There are a lot of slightly used EV's on the market in my country, almost all new cars sold here are EV's. \n\nMost of our garden is vegetable garden or flower meadow. We cut the grass twice a year. \nWe feed the birds in the winter and put up bird houses.  We don't use poison in the garden. \n\nWe try to be activists when we can and campaign for the green party in our country. \n\nMy boyfriend has been arrested 7 times for climate activism, but here it's pretty hopeless to change anything and public opinion is very anti-climate activists, and hurra for fossile fuel industry. \n\nI support environmental organisations with a small donation every month. \n\nI try to think that every dollar I use is a vote for the world I want. We have our savings in green investments or funds.  Probably not the best interest there, but I will not invest in fossile fuels."

The average temperature anomaly for the remaining two months of this year would need to drop by an unprecedented amount to almost zero for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023, making it virtually certain that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record according to ERA5.\n* Given that 2023 was 1.48\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level according to ERA5, it is likewise virtually certain that the annual temperature for 2024 from ERA5 will be more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level, and likely that it will be more than 1.55\u00b0C above."

Nuclear is extremely safe compared to other power generation methods, and nuclear waste, while nasty, is produced in tiny amounts and not hard to deal with.\n\n2) Nuclear can no longer compete with renewables and storage because renewables/storage have gotten so cheap. This one has a lot more truth to it. I personally think most governments should be working on a few nuclear reactors, because the technology will improve with investment and it's good to diversify our power sources, but in many places it's unlikely to happen, and each year it gets less likely as renewables get better and better."

                "Content": "We need to keep the current nuclear plants open, but my understanding is that nuclear is not actually all that compatible with renewables and in practice they tend to oppose each other.\n\nBasically, nuclear is one of the least \"flexible\" power sources available. While they can scale electricity output, daily plant operations are \"always on\" and it usually makes sense to just operate at full capacity. Operations are also deliberately slow and it can take awhile to make output changes.\n\nRenewables, on the other hand, are capable of providing most baseload power, but have one drawback of not being able to provide \"at-will\" output boosts if there are sharp demand peaks. For example, you can't turn the sun on to meet a massive spike in demand in the middle of the night. This issue is solved by having battery storage or something like hydrogen or natural gas power that can be quickly turned on.\n\nIf you have a power grid with both nuclear and renewables, what often ends up happening is the renewables dominate by having a lower marginal cost, and then nuclear ends up running inefficiently at a lower output.\n\nBasically, we need to keep current nuclear power plants running and let them continue powering their grids, and nuclear should still be pursued in locations where space/climate constraints are more favorable vs. renewables. In most places though, it makes way more sense to go all-in on renewables due to them being far cheaper and quicker to build.\n\nhttps://energytransition.org/2022/11/why-nuclear-power-and-renewables-dont-mix/"

It takes many years to build a nuclear plant, but even large solar plants paired with energy storage can be built quickly. As the cost of grid-scale batteries continues to drop, and manufacturing capacity scales, I'm skeptical we'll see that much nuclear development in the coming years, on account of this, amongst other factors mentioned in other posts.\n\nNuclear has some great elements - it's very land-dense, though the need for evacuation plans might limit some of that benefit. I don't know offhand how much land the mining for uranium takes up, but I doubt it'd be close to the land requirements of solar. \n\nAnd although there are objections to solar, those are driven by ignorance - people think it's going to use up the sun or poison the soil, the first of which is downright absurd, and the second, not supported by any evidence. But these still need to be dealt with to get solar deployed.\n\nMeanwhile, fear of nuclear is driven by actual disasters that have taken place."

It's still extremely expensive, and takes far too long to build considering that we needed to decarbonise yesterday.\n\nBoth have the downside of not easily meeting demand, and therefore require backup from peaking plants (generally gas or hydro) or batteries.\n\nIf a country already has Nuclear plants which are safe, they should keep using them, but for new power developments, there is very little reason to pick nuclear over renewables.\n\nThe one exception is if you don't actually want to decarbonise the grid, in which case, backing nuclear but preventing the projects from going anywhere is a brilliant idea."

They are the worst companions imaginable. Then add that nuclear power costs 3-10x as much as renewables depending on if you compare against offshore wind or solar PV.\n\nNuclear power and renewables compete for the same slice of the grid. The cheapest most inflexible where all other power generation has to adapt to their demands. They are fundamentally incompatible.\n\n[For every passing year more existing reactors will spend more time turned off because the power they produce is too expensive.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/energy-prices-negative-france-solar-panel-wind-renewable-nuclear-green-2024-6) Let alone insanely expensive new builds.\n\n[Batteries are here now and delivering nuclear scale energy day in and day out in California.](https://blog.gridstatus.io/caiso-batteries-apr-2024/)\n\nToday we should hold on to the existing nuclear fleet as long as they are safe and economical.
