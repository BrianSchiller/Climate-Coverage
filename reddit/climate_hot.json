They're volunteers, and often busy, so follow up if you don't hear back.\n* Citizens Climate Lobby \u2014 broader age range, studiously bipartisan.

Local groups can be found [here](https://350.org/get-involved/)\n* [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/) believes in the use of nonviolent civil disobedience, including a willingness of large number of people to be arrested, on a large scale to create political change.  They are most active in the UK, but also have a significant number of active local chapters in the US and other countries.  Local chapters are mostly listed [here](https://rebellion.earth/act-now/local-groups/) but some in the US are only listed at [the bottom of this page](https://extinctionrebellion.us/).\n\nIf you want to find one that works for you, go down the list (and check the comments) and find out which ones are active near you.  Attend a meeting or action or two to get a sense of what the group is like, and then start doing more to help.\n\nThere are others, and depending on you and your community, another group might be the best choice.  If you don't feel that one of these group is a good fit for you, tell us where you are and what your community is like, and ask for help.\n\nIf you think there's something significant that one of the big groups isn't handling, ask about it.  Maybe somebody can help you figure out how to get it done.",

                "Content": "If I may, I'd like to take a moment to share my experience volunteering with [Citizens' Climate Lobby](http://citizensclimatelobby.org/). \n\n* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). \n\n* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). \n\n* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  \n\n* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). \n\n* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.\n\n* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. \n\n* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). \n\n* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. \n\n* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. \n\n* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously \"Safe Passage\"](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)\n\n* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support. \n\nIt may be that at least some of these things are having an impact. [Just five years ago, only 30% of Americans supported a carbon tax](http://closup.umich.edu/issues-in-energy-and-environmental-policy/13/public-views-on-a-carbon-tax-depend-on-the-proposed-use-of-revenue/). Today, [it's over half](https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx). If you think Congress doesn't care about public support, [think again](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651). \n\nFurthermore, the [evidence clearly shows](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf) that [lobbing works](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/june-2017-meeting-analysis-1127.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to be effective](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). \n\nAnd the IPCC has been clear that [carbon pricing is **necessary**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf) if we're going to make our 1.5 \u00baC target. \n\nFor these reasons and more, [becoming an active volunteer with Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3414=reddit-carbontax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=carbontax) is [the most important thing you can do for climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8), according to climatologist and climate activist [Dr. James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen)."

                "Content": "Good list. However, for the benefit of anyone thinking of starting a chapter in a city or town where climate action is relatively new, it pays to start with the right group.\n\nCCL's tight focus on getting the US House of Representatives to pass a small revenue-neutral carbon tax can burn out volunteers who want local action, and who tire of fruitlessly beseeching the lower-level staffers of distant, science-denying House dweebs.\n\nSunrise, as a student movement, does well in larger cities and university towns, although those are not the places that need convincing.\n\nIn my experience, 350 seems to be the best, largest network of local climate activists for less liberal cities and towns to throw in with. Divestment is merely one of 350's many areas of focus, and most of its chapters seem to focus on local actions such as pushing for renewable power and electric transportation, shutting down nearby coal plants, and generally making climate a more visible issue in local politics.\n\nShout-outs as well to the Sierra Club, the Climate Reality Project, Greenpeace, the Unitarian Church, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and more.

[Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

                "Content": "Saudi Arabia is, in essence, a U.S. *[client state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state)*. In this regard, it is not a completely independent sovereign nation making decisions alone. Anyone arguing otherwise here is likely either lying, an agent working at an information warfare/PR desk, or ignorant. As the U.S. has been essentially running a protection racket for the *[House of Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud)*, the controlling family of Saudi Arabia, for well over half a century.\n\nThe U.S. supplies them with weapons, and who knows what other security and intelligence-related services, and they in turn manipulate oil market conditions on behalf of the U.S. Whether that be [selling the vast majority of their oil in U.S. Treasury-denominated debt instruments](https://archive.ph/pOaX1) like Treasury Bonds or [constricting/glutting global oil markets](https://archive.is/Wv63m#selection-1277.0-1293.222). \n\nAs an example: the U.S. and other states consume and sell the oil they produce nearly instantaneously. What Saudi Arabia has, no one else does; extremely high volumes of reserves that can be drilled, basically, on command:\n\n> [...] what matters most for stabilizing global oil prices is \u201cspare production capacity\u201d\u2014defined as how much a producer can ramp up oil production within 30 days. That spare production capacity allows a producer to ramp up\u2014or slow down\u2014oil production basically at will, shifting global prices.\n> \n> Saudi Arabia has a huge amount of spare production capacity: around [2 million barrels of oil](https://archive.ph/gDnRs) a day. Once, the United States did have spare production capacity that was managed by the [Texas Railroad Commission](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-factbox/factbox-opec-still-standing-among-the-ruins-of-former-cartels-idUSKCN0YO243/). But as more easily reached oil dried up\u2014to be replaced by harder-to-reach shale oil\u2014that power disappeared. Today, the United States\u2019 spare production capacity is zero. U.S. oil producers, many of whom are beholden to their shareholders, can\u2019t hold on to spare capacity in the same way as their Middle East counterparts.\n>  \n> Spare production capacity \u201cis expensive to maintain, which is why no other producers maintain it,\u201d said Hittle. In the U.S., she added, investors would never put up with spending capital to develop production and then letting it sit idle until the right moment.\n>  \n> Source: [The U.S. is the world\u2019s largest oil producer. You\u2019ll still pay more for gas.](https://archive.ph/BM0we#selection-1085.20-1155.261)\u2014By  Shannon Osaka | Oct. 8, 2022 (*The Washington Post*)\n\nTheir decisions can, and often do, set the market price for oil. Just based on how much they decide to produce, or most often, not produce. They don't even need OPEC to move it.\n\nIn this way, Saudi Arabia really acts as a kind of back door Federal Reserve. Because they sell their oil almost exclusively in dollars, if their decisions shoot the price of oil to the moon because they restricted supply, a lot of the dollar money supply is going to be sucked out of circulation. And this is exactly what happened during the 1970s oil shocks, and leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, where oil topped out at $150 a barrel in the Summer of that year. They can pull a lot of money out of the system. Almost overnight. **Single-handedly**. So, anyone arguing here that Saudi Arabia is acting purely in its own self-interest in regard to impeding climate change-related policy that could potentially place supply and demand restrictions on oil is 100% full of it.\n\nAs stated above, the U.S. has been using it's protection racket \"relationship\" with the House of Saud now for half a century, and more fundamentally, [since World War II](https://archive.ph/fsg85). This isn't some rogue state acting all on it's own... because muhhnayyy. **This is about U.S. power and leverage over the geopolitical landscape.**"
