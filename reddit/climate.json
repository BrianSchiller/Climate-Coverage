                "Content": "> Good businesspeople will be transitioning.\n\nI think you have a rather imprecise understanding of how capitalism works here. The people with power and money now make their money from the existing energy system and infrastructure i.e. fossil fuels. It's a gigantically profitable industry and they have massive reserves that they want to turn into trillions of dollars.\n\nThey have no interest in transitioning which is why they have no plans to. \n\nIf you think they are thinking about the long term, their track record and their current plans show that you are disastrously mistaken.\n\n> At some point, America said goodbye to the Pony Express - and we'll do it again with burning our concentrated fossil fuels where it no longer makes sense.\n\nIf left to the market, it will be 30-50 years too late to save a habitable planet. We are at 1.5C now with 2C+ about a decade away. We are way past the time where we can do anything other than dramatically reduce emissions by all means available.\n\n> We may need to keep those in store for a future when/if the world desperately needs them.\n\nSorry, do you follow this sub at all? You think the solution to some future energy shortage will be burning a ton of fossil fuels? If we want a functioning food system in a couple of decades, we have to shut this industry ASAP. I\n\n> Environmental regulations bring new businesses, new jobs, safer communities, and cascading benefits.\n\nIndeed they do. But they impose costs on existing businesses. And it's the existing businesses that are buying the politicians.\n\nCorporations are in it for profits. They aren't enlightened planners of our society. That is what we are supposed to have democratic governments for. Unfortunately, our governments are now owned and run in the interests of capitalist oligarchs, not us.\n\n> Part of it is simply education - and accurate economic news reporting. \n\nThe industries most resisting the transition are the ones who knew most about it first. It's not about education. It's about power and the self interest of capitalist corporations.\n\n> The world is about to change drastically. America deserves a good seat at the table.\n\nAmerica is the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases. It is the home of the biggest fossil fuel industry in the world. It is the headquarters of the global climate denial system and it has wrought terrible destruction around the world in search of profits for its corporations, the fossil fuel industry being probably the most egregious, destructive and damaging. Even now, the US occupies a third of Syria so ConocoPhillips and Occidental can extract Syria's oil.\n\nI think the US *deserves* to pay trillions in reparations to the rest of the world and to ramp down its emissions to zero over the next 15 years."

                "Content": "I am not saying that Biden's policy hasn't driven activity in the wind, solar and EV markets.\n\nThe problem is that climate change isn't caused by an absence of those things and they don't remove carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nThe main cause of climate change is the fossil fuel industry. Under Biden, and with his help, that industry has **significantly** expanded to the point that it is producing planet-boiling fossil fuels faster than at any time in history.\n\nThat makes Biden bad on climate. Not just imperfect. \"Imperfect\" would be failing to reduce emissions in line with the Paris targets (which obviously he hasn't done either). Biden has actively made the situation worse by expanding the fossil fuel industry at a time when it has to be managed down. \n\nNot because I want that. Not because it's a good political ploy. Not because progressives would see that as a win. Not even because I hate the psychopaths who run the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIt has to be managed down right now because the atmospheric physics dictates that if it isn't, we will pass irreversible tipping points in the climate system and we will rapidly lose a habitable climate. There are no marks for effort or good intentions here.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Trump could probably find ways to be worse. But be under no illusion. Biden has been net bad for the climate."

                "Content": "> No, because the real issue is whether the fossil fuels industry has a future or not. The real killing blow to the fossil fuels industry is going to be an adequate alternative that is economically viable. By expanding the wind, solar, EV and similar industries, you're preparing for the long term decline in fossil fuels.\n\nWhat \"long term\"?! We have to cut global emissions at insane rates now thanks to 4 more wasted years. 1.5C is now completely out the window and in the rear view mirror. We need emissions cuts in the region of 8-10% per year to hit 2C now.\n\nAnd growth in renewables does not guarantee the death of the fossil fuel industry. Under capitalism, the GDP has to grow at least 3% per year to keep the system stable. Which means the GDP will literally double by 2050. And energy use is effectively pegged to GDP. It's an extremely tightly correlated relationship for robust structural reasons.\n\nWhich means that renewables growth can be huge and it still doesn't end fossil fuels - renewables just add to them. Which is precisely what we are seeing now. \n\n> However, yes the US oil production is insanely high, but you've got to consider the massive increase in oil prices during Bidens term, along with the spike in LNG demand which has increased exports and thus the demand for fracked gas (which Biden is also trying to limit by stopping the permitting of new LNG terminals).\n\nThe reason production went up was because of government policy both under Trump and Biden. \n\nTemporarily high prices, and this is well documented, were due to some producers temporarily holding back production after the pandemic because it was a way to spike prices as demand returned to the economy, and this generates spectacular profits in the short term. Giving the greenlight to MVP or Willow Project or Line 3 etc etc etc has zero impact on that situation.\n\nAnd if the response to every energy shortage is \"quick - build more fossil fuel infrastructure!\" then hopefully you can see that we are definitely totally dead.\n\nThere were other options available when Europe (primarily Germany) suddenly needed to replace the gas supply from Germany. Remember when Ukraine and the US blew up Nordstream, Germany actually had to spend billions of euros to expand its LNG import facilities. It took time. It is investing at least 10 billion euros more on larger, permanent facilities. It didnt have to do this. It could have invested in clean forms of energy and energy storage. But instead it turned to expensive, very dirty LNG from the USA to plug the gap. How convenient.\n\nRemember, we are in a climate emergency NOW. It's not in the future. It is already having catastrophic effects including in Germany. Building fossil fuel infrastructure now is like pouring petrol on the fire which is consuming your home. Germany had alternatives. It chose US LNG.\n\n> So while the trend has been upwards it is only a temporary increase due to the geopolitical situation. Overall, the trend is towards a greener future.\n\nNo, it isn't. This is fantasy based on zero empirical evidence. The fossil fuel industry is rapidly expanding across the world. It has long term plans for even more expansion.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\n\nThis article is now out of date. There are several new projects that weren't on this list from 2022.\n\n> Also, the US political system is screwed which has basically tied Bidens one hand, limiting his action on climate.\n\nNo, the US political system is working exactly as designed and Biden is playing his part.\n\nThe US is a capitalist oligarchic empire. Biden's job, and he has done this job better than most throughout his whole career, is to serve that oligarchy. And along with the banks and the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry is at the front of the queue when it comes to state support and collaboration. For gods sake, the US expended literally trillions of dollars on the war in Iraq specifically for the fossil fuel industry, and Biden was one of the biggest backers of the war in Congress - Democrat or Republican.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SemNT372CIw?si=l3OSsqOooobhH2F4\n\nI don't know who you think Biden is but I suspect you have the wrong idea."

Normal political struggle is a competition for power and resources. This is a struggle to save everything. If we don't win, there will be no politics in the future.\n\nOur current political economy is set up to destroy the environment. It's part of the core logic of capitalism to extract and pollute as much as possible and, necessarily, at an ever increasing rate. Capitalism is addicted to GDP growth and GDP is tied to resource extraction and energy use. If we don't get out of this economic paradigm, we will lose.\n\nThat's why I abandoned a reformist frame for action ages ago.

Nuclear competes with the very-long-duration storage which is needed to deal with seasonal variation and very rare extended periods of cloudy still days covering large areas.  Whether it can actually compete is very much an open question; storage can have learning-by-doing in small increments with relatively low risk to the public in a way that nuclear can't."

Also he said it was only at concentration levels of CO2 around 1000ppm, that it would become dangerous for humans since we would have difficulty concentrating. Basically he sounded like a climate change denier. That man seems to have radicalized himself on his own platform."

It also quotes him as saying that reducing carbon emissions is important to preserve the planet.  \nI am trying to figure out what his game plan might be. He has allied himself with climate change deniers when his Tesla electric vehicles are, to some extent, climate change solutions. He has an interest in colonizing Mars but any Mars colony would require a functioning civilization on Earth for it to survive."

                "Content": "There are some valid points and some deceitfully framed arguments from both Fonda and Sammy Roth, the OP here.\n\nExisting but mothballed nuclear? Sure, fire Three Mile Island up right now, provided there are no issues with the cooling water. I have to be as honest as I'm able, so that's a rock solid plus one for OP.\n\nCriticising renewable subsidies is churlish at best. On the other side, nuclear has negative externalities such as unremediated uranium mine sites & tailings dams, plus damage to groundwater as OP correctly points out. It's a weaker counterargument for sure, but analyses have demonstrated that solar PV and wind are the cheapest new build options by a significant margin, and notwithstanding that that margin is largely wiped out by the cost of transmission lines and batteries, panels and turbines continue to become cheaper and more efficient, while OP's SMRs remain firmly in the domain of superpower navies.\n\nOP has a valid criticism about land clearing for PV, but turbine bird deaths are and will conceivably be only a fraction of those from buildings. Sea life deaths from offshore turbines have not been demonstrated and could not conceivably occur outside of construction, with the exception of sea bird deaths which may be acceptably minimised by avoiding sensitive areas.\n\nI don't know why production subsidies to PV owners is in this list; it doesn't fit and if we're going to let voodoo economists into the room then we should have them analyse the opportunity costs of all that R & D money and fat government contracts fission has received for decades, not forgetting to account for subsidies renewable research has also received, of course.\n\nLithium mining as it currently exists is problematic, as OP correctly points out, but not inherently so: we have lithium mines here in Western Australia and while they're not as \"efficient\" in economic terms they're certainly acceptably clean.\n\nI won't speak to the situation in the USA, but new nuclear as it stands here in Australia is a non starter, for all the above reasons plus the mind wittering expense, complexities, cost of labour (train the corps of nuclear engineers, plus the opportunity cost of them not doing something else), regulatory hurdles (we gotta write laws from scratch) and the nimbyism which applies to just about anything but -rightly or wrongly- is particularly acute for reactors.\n\nYet our opposition leader ~~Lord Voldemort~~ Peter Dutton has a ~~lanthanide~~ *actinide* reinforced, PPP plated chubby for six, count them, reactors?? <Shakes head sadly>"

                "Content": ">let me know what you think\n\nI think the text does exactly what it accuses Fonda of, only in reverse. The main argument seems to revolve around portraying renewables as bad. First, the assertion that they wouldn't be able to provide power \"around the clock\" even with batteries, and then this paragraph with an full-out anti-renewable bashing:\n\n>Everywhere you look, there are value judgments. What\u2019s worse: leveling a Joshua tree forest to build a solar farm or offering rooftop solar incentives that drive up electric rates for everyone else?\n\nSeriously? How would leveling a forest be necessary, and why do incentives to put solar panels on rooftops instead have to drive up costs for everyone? Sounds quite disingeneous.\n\n>Should we put wind turbines on land, where they kill birds, or offshore, where they might harm marine life?\n\nWhy not apply siting rules that minimize those impacts, and how come there aren't any complaints about other high-rise buildings that kill birds, or the fishing industry that harms marine life? Off-shore wind farms even provides a [refuge for some marine life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S100107422300205X).\n\n>How about the fact that lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that store solar and wind power, can fuel environmentally destructive mining?\n\nBut when it is storing nuclear generated electicity in EVs it is somehow better?\n\n>In an argument reminiscent of right-wing talking points against renewable power,\n\nThat's not just reminiscent that paragraph literally repeats those talking points.\n\n>These are hard questions.\n\nNo these are not hard questions, they are bogus questions with false dichotomies. We should not clear non-cultivated land for solar farms, there is more than sufficient space on cultivated and built-on land to put solar panels on. Wind turbines should be properly sited with mechanisms to protect wild-life as much as possible. That isn't a reason for not expanding low-carbon power supply as quickly as possible to reduce fossil fuel burning.\n\n>I am here to ask everyone reading this: Do you have any opinions you\u2019d consider changing if it meant preserving a livable planet, for yourself and future generations?\n\nOf course, I am willing to change any of my opinions.\n\n>Any habits or lifestyle choices you\u2019d be willing to alter?\n\nYes, though I don't see how this is connected to the argument at hand.\n\nWe don't necessarily *need* solar, or wind, or nuclear, or hydro, or geothermal you could think up all kinds of different low-carbon systems from nuclear only to solar+batteries only. The question is what is the best strategy for a quick replacement of fossil fuel burning. And the answer to that almost certainly varies from region to region. It is the blatant denial of solutions like this: \"*What\u2019s more, solar panels and wind turbines can\u2019t power society 24/7.*\" that are not helpful in mapping out the space of possible solutions for the *hard* problem of climate change."

Here's how it starts:\n\n>*Jane Fonda is a powerful, passionate climate advocate. She\u2019s\u00a0gotten arrested\u00a0protesting at the U.S. Capitol,\u00a0raised money\u00a0to defeat a Big Oil ballot measure in California and\u00a0written a book\u00a0about activism. She lives her values.*\n\n>*So I was disappointed by some of the anti-nuclear arguments Fonda made in a\u00a0recent opinion piece.*\n\n>*Writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fonda slammed a deal to\u00a0restart Pennsylvania\u2019s Three Mile Island nuclear plant, site of an infamous 1979 partial meltdown that destroyed one of the site\u2019s two reactors. The plant\u2019s owner has agreed to restart the functioning reactor \u2014 which shut down five years ago because it was losing money \u2014 now that tech giant Microsoft has agreed to buy the climate-friendly electricity to supply its data centers.*\n\n>*It\u2019s no surprise that Fonda isn\u2019t happy. She\u2019s fought nuclear power for decades, rallying against\u00a0California\u2019s Diablo Canyon plant\u00a0and starring in a 1979 film,\u00a0\u201cThe China Syndrome,\u201d\u00a0that warns of nuclear energy\u2019s dangers.*\n\n>*\u201cI understand the temptation to embrace nuclear,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe absolutely need to phase out oil, gas, and coal \u2014 the fossil fuels overheating our planet \u2014 and fast. Any means of achieving that goal deserves consideration.\u201d*\n\n>*Ultimately, though, Fonda doesn\u2019t seem interested in giving nuclear much consideration.*\n\nAgain, I hope you'll read the whole thing and let me know what you think.

In a 2009 experiment in the southwest Atlantic Ocean by German and Indian scientists, larger zooplankton ate the smaller phytoplankton\u2014and little carbon actually reached the deep sea. In an experiment that was conducted in 2006 in the northeastern Pacific by researchers in the U.S. and Canada, toxic phytoplankton species\u00a0flourished. This has raised fears that fertilization could create \u201cdead zones\u201d where rampant algal blooms would consume all the oxygen in the water, snuffing out other life. Phytoplankton blooms could also consume nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen that then wouldn\u2019t be available for organisms elsewhere, a phenomenon known as \u201cnutrient robbing.\u201d In addition, scientists still know little about the deep-ocean ecosystems where the carbon is supposed to be stored. \u201cMost likely [iron fertilization] will affect something that we don\u2019t really understand yet,\u201d says deep-sea expert Lisa Levin of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who is not involved in the ExOIS program. Last year a\u00a0computer modeling study\u00a0done by British, American and French researchers found that adding one million to two million metric tons of iron into the ocean each year could draw down 45 billion metric tons of carbon by 2100. It would also rob nutrients from other sea life, however. Along with an estimated 15 percent reduction in marine biomass caused by warming, another 5 percent could be lost because of iron fertilization, particularly in fishing areas near the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian coasts. \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen [ExOIS] present a hypothesis of what\u2019s wrong with previous work ... that either makes the carbon yield higher or minimizes the negative consequences,\u201d says Alessandro Tagliabue of the University of Liverpool in England, co-lead author of that study."

New coal plants are being cancelled and old ones are being decommissioned. \n\nSaying something positive about China isn't propaganda, always trying to find the negative \"but at what cost??\" in everything good they do is.

Not existing is not a negative thing, it's not even neutral, because it's not on the spectrum of virtue; it can't be. It's only because we exist that we can even conceive of not existing. \n\nObviously not all of life is bad, and I'm sure that for some, potentially even most, people, life is 'worth it,' but there's absolutely no way to guarantee that this will be the case for your children. Perhaps this is a risk that someone is willing to take, but the choice to take this inherent risk is non-consensual. In that sense, it is always at least a little selfish. Because, again, the person who is to become your child is not capable of missing out on any experience whilst they don't exist."

And people still have kids because well.... There is a chance that they may have some sort of good life or their life may improve somehow. I think it is that hope that makes having a kid not necessarily selfish. When you have a kid you believe they will have good moments, they will be able to enjoy life, they will be ok (it can be a delusion for sure... But I do think most parents believe this... And they try what they can to make this happen). Also if you ask around even to people that suffer a lot if they prefer to never exist at all or to have experienced life, even when sucked. Probably say the last one. And finally there is always the option to...well ... Give up on life (I want to be clear that I am not advocating for suicide... Well except euthanasia for terminal conditions. But other than that there is other solutions). When you exist you always have the option to terminate that existence. While if you never existed you never had even the opportunity to have an existence."

You don't capture carbon at the data center, you capture it at the power plant.  And DAC is a high energy consumption pipe dream, which only works when you have super abundant and clean energy - a handful of places in the world (like geothermal facilities) work for this, there is absolutely nothing special about a datacenter which suggests it would do better than any random air for DAC, and the energy in use there is generally very high emission and not worthwhile when trading generation emissions versus the capture from DAC.\n\nThey used AI to guess at what kind of structures might act as super-sorbents?

While the United States, in its typical way, argues endlessly about what is real, China, in the 80s, in the midst of their Industrial Revolution, had already started focussing on climate as an issue. She said simply, its not a democracy there is no argument, or debate, its just \u201cthis is what we are doing\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIn a country where dissent is economic, and its basically Corporations directing the arguments, you will always see slow changes. The US is more concerned with not disrupting the fossil fuel industry, easing its transition to renewables; than it is concerned climate change, or even outpacing China.\u00a0"

                "Content": "It tracks that china would be building more coal plants, than say England, since england already has pretty much already has all the coal plants it needs, probably built in the 40s...  The article states they need to find energy to cope with heatwaves, and a because the war and Ukraine has made Natural Gas so expensive.  You also have to consider while China may be just ahead of the US interms of emissions, they also have 4-5 x the population of the US, and so much of the manufacturing, so really all the people buying Chinese made products should be sharing in responsibility for Chinese emissions. The computer I am typing on for example.\n\nThat being said, the US is doing almost nothing to address climate change, California is just now thinking about maybe making a few commuter trains in its major cities, and Texas is using some tax incentives to build solar fields.   Even the infrastructure bill, is being used to repave roads, and the US is also tapping more and more fossil fuels, the Biden admin has certainly not slowed down on oil and gas leases, or even coal for that matter. Not to mention the US military is the single biggest pollution causing entity on the planet.  Even t AOC, is too busy harrassing Jill Stein to remember her hopes and dreams about a green new deal. \n\nThe title of the article is \"what if China stops trying to save the world\" totally stupid headline, but might get people to notice the US is lagging, trapped by corporate interests,  which does't bode well for the future, or our little attempts to maintain world domination."

Since October, Israel has murdered 40,000+ Palestinians in Gaza including 14,000+ children with our tax dollars. This is genocide.**\n\n**We\u2019re all paying the price of this genocide\u2014with our tax dollars.

That\u2019s a difference of $363 billion, which would be enough to fund solar power for nearly every household in the U.S. for 10 years.**\n\n>>fund the country that will probably eventually start WW3 says u/Romanfiend\n\nYes, that would be the Israeli Trump, Netanyahu, who wants to prolong the bombing to delay his corruption trials\n\n**Netanyahu Accused of Risking WWIII to Save His Own Skin**\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/netanyahu-accused-of-risking-wwiii-to-save-his-own-skin\n\nThe United States emerged from its victory in World War II as the world\u2019s preeminent superpower. Its annual military budget\u2014about three-quarters of a trillion dollars a year\u2014exceeds the aggregate of the next ten countries in the world.\n\nYet **despite America\u2019s apparent global military supremacy, of the approximately dozen wars the U.S. has fought since 1945 (depending on how you\u2019re counting) the U.S. has lost every real war it has fought.

During the Afghanistan War, the stocks of the five largest defense contractors outperformed the S&P 500 by 58%. Fortunes end up in the pockets of corporate executives.

She's not an expert in other fields and despite efforts to overcome it, is too often wrong and brings her own prejudices and assumptions.\n\nFor example on climate change: she had some interesting points on methodology on the \"hot models\" problem -  in part with her discussions and work with Tim Palmer, a huge figure in the field. For me, that became a useful starting point for reading into the problem elsewhere with others who have worked on the problem. But then she extrapolates into talking about her own opinions that we cannot adapt enough and dismisses climate action - she simply has no evidence on this and has  nothing to back up her opinion, but has a lot of video airtime to fill to create podcast content every week."

The only terrorism in the environmental movement has been committed by industry and the government. And if you equate destruction of inanimate objects with violence, your respect for human life is quite limited. Second, Even people that are concerned about climate change don\u2019t feel a visceral, urgent reaction. There\u2019s no immediacy. People use the word crisis without feeling a crisis. Compare Black Lives Matter (a reaction to an almost imaginary crisis of police killings) or Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza (a crisis that affects only Palestinians in Gaza) to any climate change activism. People are committed to lawful or minimally unlawful passive protest because they don\u2019t actually care as much as they say they do. I\u2019m not saying a more extreme response is effective or not effective but if people felt passionately enough it would happen regardless."

Actually shutting something down through sabotage would require repeated attacks aimed at more expensive parts of the system, such as pumping stations and refineries.\n\nIn practice, any actual sabotage effort would likely be more effective at getting press if aimed at the luxury goods of the super-wealthy such as the huge private motor yachts or jets that billionaires use."

                "Content": "new ending: \n\n# Part 3: A New Paradigm of Rapid Regeneration and Growing Energy Demand\n\nThe Net Zero activists and Ted Kaczinsky fail to see that a rapid rise of AI has transformed global energy dynamics, creating unprecedented opportunities to rethink energy production. With AI energy demand projected to grow exponentially, what might initially seem like a burden becomes an opportunity to scale sustainable, renewable energy infrastructure. Unlike previous eras of industrial expansion that heavily relied on fossil fuels, this moment offers the chance to align energy growth with ecological restoration.\n\n# 1. AI-Driven Energy Innovation:\n\nAI itself can be a key driver of energy efficiency and sustainability. From optimizing solar panel placements to enhancing grid management with predictive algorithms, AI technologies are enabling faster deployment of renewables. The sheer demand for energy to power AI systems\u2014akin to a modern industrial revolution\u2014is spurring investment in scalable solutions like solar farms, wind power, and advanced battery storage. This demand-driven growth creates economies of scale, making clean energy cheaper and more accessible.\n\n# 2. Ecological Restoration as a Balancing Act:\n\nWhile energy expansion is necessary to meet AI-driven growth, it must be paired with ecological restoration to offset environmental impacts. Technologies like reforestation drones, bioengineered carbon sinks, and AI-assisted land rehabilitation can restore habitats and capture carbon emissions. For example, regions undergoing renewable energy infrastructure development can simultaneously implement restoration projects, such as wetland reconstruction or rewilding efforts, ensuring that energy growth contributes to ecological health rather than harm.\n\n# 3. Energy for Restoration:\n\nAI-driven energy innovation doesn\u2019t just meet human needs\u2014it can also directly fuel ecological restoration. Clean energy sources can power desalination plants for reforesting arid regions, support biotechnological breakthroughs in soil regeneration, and sustain large-scale carbon removal projects. The synergy between energy abundance and restoration efforts creates a virtuous cycle: energy expansion supports ecological repair, and healthy ecosystems enhance climate resilience.\n\n# 4. A Future of Abundance and Balance:\n\nThis new paradigm doesn\u2019t ask humanity to shrink its ambitions or retreat from progress. Instead, it invites us to grow intelligently\u2014leveraging technological innovation to harmonize energy needs with environmental stewardship. AI\u2019s rising energy demand can become the catalyst for a new era of sustainable abundance, where human advancement and ecological health are no longer at odds. By meeting energy challenges head-on while actively restoring the planet, we can turn a potential crisis into a transformative opportunity.\n\nThis paradigm aligns human progress with ecological health, embracing technology as a tool for both growth and restoration. Unlike Kaczynski\u2019s vision of dismantling industrial society or the sustainability movement\u2019s calls for restraint, rapid regeneration and energy abundance offer a hopeful middle path."

This is already how they treat their kids, this is how people have always treated their kids. \n\nIt's probably too stressful to have children and worry about everything that happens to them, but it leads to an attitude of just assuming things will work out. \n\nWell here's the truth: There's no guarantee that things will work out. You have to MAKE things work out, and even then, there's still no guarantee. But parents today aren't even trying. \"The next generation are smart, they will figure it out\".\n\nIt's negligent and tbh it's evil to dump billions of tons of co2 in the air and then leave it for the next person to 'figure out'.

Which means they just assume that Reagan is right: the only limit is our imagination. They assume technology that doesn't exist yet is going to be a fact.\n\nThey also talk about sodium batteries as if they have no constraints themselves. That was amusing. \n\nI found something interesting though. Simon Michaux's report is based on the IEA predictions and he basically crunched the numbers. That makes me suspect that the IEA did not crunch their numbers. \n\nCan you provide me with the IEA numbers of how much we need of each mineral? I have friends coming over. I have stuff to do."

How do I know he isn\u2019t approaching the question seriously from a climate or ecological perspective? He doesn\u2019t engage with the questions of which fuels and heating methods are carbon-intensive, carbon-negative, and carbon-\u201cneutral\u201d. It\u2019s a big consideration, in addition to obviously worthy health and acute pollution concerns.\n\nBut by only talking about the latter, I believe he\u2019s crafting the \u201cSchwarzeneggerian frame\u201d, named after the governator, of seeming to talk about climate change, while really only talking about instances of acute toxic pollution, and framing responses to these as executable only through individual choice. It is a propagandistic frame, designed by companies and their conservative political servants, to let energy producers and resource extractors off the hook. It tries to convince people implicitly that as long as there isn\u2019t arsenic in the chimney, burning carbon is fine."

So the alternative is to burn natural gas, a fossil fuel, burn electrictricity, at great cost, die or get ill from being too cold!\nOur very existence has consequences for planet, people and other life so we need least bad not any absolute solution. The main real issue with any solid fuel burning is particulate mater (PM) which are important issues. However as a cultist member of the devoute order of wood burning stoves lovers. I think it's blasphemy to point out pesky scientific issues that might make me question my membership of this cult.\n\nI do think before banning my cult consideration should be given to banning open fires, particularly in pubs, no, because they require massive ventilation for combustion and secondary air. Then ensuring regularly maintenance of of wood burning stoves and boilers. Further actions might include ducted air supplies to the stove to save sucking out heated air for combustion purposes. Gasification particularly with LAMBDA control.\n\nWe live on the edge of a rural town and love the heat from our very efficient Jotul stove with ducted combustion air supply. I collect our own wood and process mostly with solar powered saw it reduces the amount of natural gas we consume. Before banning my cult the powers that be should make the pilgrimage to Drax the government funded wood powered generator that imports 'sustainable' wood from the US in vast great quantity!!!"

Even if every of the 10,000 rockets that hezbollah has shot was a 1 tonne bomb (i\u2019ll give you a hint, none were even near that magnitude), they would barely have dropped a tenth of the mass of bombs which Israel has dropped. \n\nTrying to both sides the environmental impact of the current crisis in the middle east is simply ridiculous. Especially once you consider the human toll of all this, 41,000+ people killed, 100,000+ injured, 20,000+ children killed, all 114 hospitals+health clinics in gaza destroyed\u2026 \n\nSure, iran, hezbollah, and hamas are no saints, but nothing they have done or will ever do will come close to the devastation israel has caused."

Believe it or not, the situation in Palestine is MORE complicated and MORE contentious than climate change is, for the vast majority of people. \n\nThis is not a clear cut issue the same way climate change is. And tying the 2 together is ABSOLUTELY going to degrade support for the climate at a time when the movement was finally picking up steam. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly short sighted\u2026 much like the insane one sighted support for either Palestine or Israel.

This is the worst crime committed by a state in decades. \n\n**And no one is stopping Israel.**\n \nThey have declared their intention over and over. They want the whole of the Palestinians' land to be Israel, populated by Israeli jews. They aren't hiding this. It's in their rhetoric every day. \n\nYou need to adjust your understanding of what is going on here. It isn't a war with military aims for security. It's a genocide designed to empty the region of Palestinians, either by ethnic cleansing or the physical destruction of the people."

The inability to address the problem stems from lack of political will, to be sure, but our institutions and our very psychology are not designed or adapted to handle a problem of this scale, which is why we've only ever been able to make incremental progress.\n\nIn other words, the socialist rhetoric is not very helpful."

As expected, the US leads the world in cumulative emissions (118 million tons, compared to 74 million for China), while China is currently emitting the most CO2 per year (12 million tons, vs. 5 million tons for the US).\n\nHowever, this fails to account for the fact that a large portion of America's resource extraction and manufacturing has been exported to countries like China and India over the past 30 years, to the tune of over [$3 trillion per year](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions). Accounting for emissions in a global economy is [very complex](https://archive.is/CcxqH) (and somewhat arbitrary), but all estimates show [China's emissions decreasing](https://ourworldindata.org/consumption-based-co2) (and US emissions increasing) when we do.

That was intensely political.\n\nWe will likely get to a point in the future where a large majority of electricity generation in the US is solar; whether that's in 15 years or 50 is still an open question, no matter how bad the consequences of waiting for the 50 would be."

Opposition to offshore wind power facilities off the Northeast coast involves a peculiar assortment of bedfellows, including local environmental groups, fisheries and seafood producers, a hotel association and former president Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to certain environmental groups, solar, wind, hydropower, nuclear are all bad.

In industries like steel, cement, and chemicals, CO2\u00a0is emitted from the production process, some of which can be captured. If stored properly, this will actually reduce CO2\u00a0emissions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cProcess emissions, which result from chemical reactions and therefore cannot be avoided by switching to alternative fuels, account for one-quarter (almost 2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide \\[GtCO2\\]) of industrial emissions\u201d -International Energy Agency\n\nCapturing process emissions is notoriously complex and uncertain, and few carbon capture projects focused on process emissions exist. According to an analysis by Zero Carbon Analytics, the steel sector is responsible for 7% of energy-related CO2\u00a0emissions, and only one carbon capture facility exists.\u00a0\n\nSo if we are going to invest in carbon capture, this is where it needs to be."

Warming of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by 2050 is unlikely, said climate scientist\u00a0Michael Mann, director of the\u00a0Center for Science, Sustainability & the Media at the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\n> Mann said he doesn\u2019t think the findings in the draft paper will withstand peer review because the research doesn\u2019t adequately account for the cooling effects of cutting other short-lived climate-warming pollutants, which can offset the heating resulting from the reduction of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. Black soot, which absorbs heat from the sun, can warm the atmosphere in the short term, and other\u00a0extremely potent industrial pollutants\u00a0emitted in tiny quantities have an outsized climate heating effect.\n\n> Calculations of those different effects are included in the most recent\u00a0global climate assessments\u00a0by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that serve as the basis for global climate policy talks, he said.\u00a0\n\n> The IPCC reports show that the competing effects nearly cancel each other out, which would make 2 degrees Celsius warming by 2050 less likely. But those same IPCC projections include big cuts of methane emissions as another key to offsetting the spike in warming from the reduction of atmospheric sulfates. But methane emissions are not declining; they\u2019ve accelerated sharply the past five years\n\n[Link](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26052023/james-hansen-climate-change-2-degrees-2050/#:~:text=Hansen's%20previous%20warning%20about%20the,warm%20ocean%20and%20land%20surfaces.)\n\nI mean, a big heat spike has come with every El-Ni\u00f1o since 1998. And it just occurred again. Heat coming off the earth's surface is incapable of making it's natural journey into space. Due to 420ppm of CO2 in the troposphere. And that's that."

I could be wrong, and I am open to changing my thoughts.\n\nFirst, the overall discussion of Milton is very doomsday-ish. Yes, it's a monster, but we will recover and we will adjust. Claiming Cat 5's will be the new normal is just the opposite side of the same coin of people thinking you can steer hurricanes. There is so much wrong with both, you don't even know where to start. I feel like climate change conversations are the same. The storm is here. We should talk about how to live with it - not how to undo it.\n\nNext, many of the trigger points have already reached critical moments that we are still hoping are reversible. Really, how in the world would we speed up global ocean currents - after 50+ years of slowing them down? And that is just 1 of the many large systems that are at this point - much less the dozens of smaller ones.\n\nThe Antarctic ice has been extremely, record-breaking low 2 years in a row! How many sub-systems stalled for that to happen? Do we even know of them all? Sure, the Antarctic waxes and wanes, but but never to this degree. Its done - that ice is never coming back to the same levels.\n\nAlso, the world's largest fossil fuel deposit was just discovered near those waters. There is a treaty keeping countries from drilling, but that expires in 20 years, so good luck keeping companies out of there. \n\nSpeaking of carbon dioxide, for some reason people tried to cling to the smokes and mirrors that Covid brought down carbon emissions AND the world started improving. Sorry, the record low ice levels where after Covid, the oceans currents continued to decline, and methane from the permafrost never stopped. Too many gears are turning too quickly at this point. \n\nIf I smoked for 70 years, and I got lung cancer, then reducing my smoking for 2 years isn't going to do anything. Too many systems have failed. It's done.\n\nThere is no putting methane back in the permafrost, so thats already a run-away system. This change is due to 50+ years of actions leading in that direction, so even slowing it down is not possible. \n\nI don't need to mention wars, war-tactics, and the local environments, because it's obvious. Plus, for those people in those regions, I cannot blame (you can't worry about scarring when you are on fire). However, I wonder how many Tesla need to replace gasoline vehicles to make up for a sinking tanker or destroyed oilfield? \n\nThen we have solar energy, which has been scammed onto most homes through companies, promising lower bills, cashing out government subsidies, sub-contracting 15 layers of sevices to the point you don't know who to contact if your battery dies - hopefully, before the company folds, renames itself, and pops back with a new, updated scam terms. However, this behavior is having a cultural effect - people are losing trust in the entire idea of switching to solar energy.\n\nRecycling is a joke that doesn't even need to be discussed at the moment. Between, Africa, China, and a few other countries, recycling just means, \"I want this trash really, really far away.\", and some companies charge you an extra $250 a quarter for it. Pass.\n\nI don't want to get too far into the weeds when it comes to people and understanding, but you have the so many who think we are pushing a 700-mile wide storm around, and others think that oceans are going to be 3-feet higher in 10 years. And that is just raw ignorance, not even monetarily motivated ignorance. Its not been until very recently that people have become accepting of nuclear energy. Until we see a global crisis in our face, then this is not going to change.\n\nI don't know. Sorry if this isn't the place for random thoughts, but I feel like we are too far gone. I feel like we are wasting time and money talking about sucking carbon dioxide out of the air, when conversation should start focusing how to adjust to how Earth is changing.\n\n",

When you gaslight in that manner, you at least look like you are here to campaign for your bias, rather than genuinely talk honestly with others.\n\nHave you BEEN to Yellowstone?  I've spent many years living nearby and visiting as often as possible.  Even spent a week with NASA people on a field trip.  Yeah, I am familiar with the place.\n\nSure, it has a HUGE thermal potential.   You're right.\n\nHOWEVER..... what we *know* about the thermal workings of the place is not zero.  But it is still akin to what we *know* about the surface of Alpha Centuari.... which is *close* to zero.  You go out there and spend several days with USGS or NPS or NASA and get back to me, if after that you still disagree.,\n\nMy belief is.... we are beyond stupid if we muck about with a MASSIVE and potentially dangerous system that is so little understood.\n\n*However.....* the notion of geothermal energy is v.....e.....r.....y...... enticing.  So let's do R&D on a smaller scale in other smaller areas, scattered throughout the west.  There are \"hot springs\" in most of the western states, from the coast east to the continental divide.  We should start on a smaller scale, I think.  If we screw up royally, it will (hopefully) be just an oopsie rather than a catastrophe."

You even start your column with a quote from His Dark Materials, which contains vastly more creative ideas than that, all generated by a human.\n\nOne of the many things I dislike about AI is how those pushing it for their own profit persistently belittle human ability, creativity and ingenuity. It tells us that human beings could never produce the images like the ones above. But of course they could. They have (often that's what AI is harvesting for its own images).\n\nThe difference is that AI does it faster. But so what? Why is that important, especially when by speeding up that process we also rob humans of the chance to take the reins of that creativity (while guzzling an enormous amount of energy)?\n\nLastly, I challenge the fatalism of this phrase: \"But like it or not, AI is here to stay.\" I find that fatalism in itself part of the propaganda of AI; like saying \"Like it or not, Trump is here to stay\".\n\nIs it? Why? There are already various indications that the AI bubble is about to burst, like so many other useless, limited and destructive technologies before it that have similarly been shoved down our throats by Silicon Valley ego-monsters.\n\nLots of good critique of the supposed achievements of AI here:\n\n[https://www.wheresyoured.at/](https://www.wheresyoured.at/)"

                "Content": "Hi all, I hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think. Here's how it starts:\n\n>*\u201cTell them stories. They need the truth. You must tell them true stories, and everything will be well.\u201d*\n\n>*So says the ghost of an old woman to nun-turned-astrophysicist Mary Malone in \u201cThe Amber Spyglass,\u201d the final tome in Philip Pullman\u2019s \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d trilogy and one of my favorite novels. The admonition came to mind as I explored an unusual art exhibit at the USC\u2019s Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, two dozen miles off the Southern California coast.*\n\n>*A series of 11 images envisions a sustainable future for Los Angeles \u2014 as dreamed up by artificial intelligence.*\n\n>*One image shows a downtown streetscape, shaded by overhead walkways teeming with vegetation. Another adds solar panels to the hillsides beneath the Hollywood sign. Several contemplate vibrant futures for the L.A. River, tearing out\u00a0concrete flood-control straitjackets\u00a0along its banks and reviving the waterway with abundant plants and wildlife, as well as walking paths.*\n\n>*One especially mind-bending picture replaces cars with bicycles on a freeway along the river.*\n\n>*Are any of these visions realistic? Does it matter if they could ever be \u201ctrue\u201d?*\n\n>*And how should we feel about the fact that shadowy computer brains played a role in creating them?*\n\n>*I posed those questions to Allison Agsten, the art curator at USC\u2019s Wrigley Institute for Environment and Sustainability. She also leads the Center for Climate Journalism and Communication at USC\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and she oversaw development of the sustainable L.A. exhibit. She has mixed feelings about artificial intelligence herself.*\n\n>*\u201cThis installation represents an experiment,\u201d Agsten said.*\n\n>*And not always a smooth one, she was quick to acknowledge.*\n\n>*Catalina Island has been\u00a0plagued by invasive mule deer, which were introduced by humans in the 1930s for hunting. According to the Catalina Island Conservancy, the nonnative deer destroy natural habitats, increasing fire risk and harming native animals.*\n\n>*But when USC cinematic arts professor Kathy Smith and three grad students asked their AI programs, which\u00a0included\u00a0Midjourney and OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E, to dream up a sustainable Catalina, one of the programs created an image of \u201ca flourishing deer population,\u201d Agsten recalled \u2014 seemingly tricked by all the online discussion into thinking that more deer would be good, not terrible.*\n\n>*\u201cI said \\[to the students\\], let\u2019s talk about why that image isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Agsten told me.*\n\n>*The invasive mule deer didn\u2019t make the exhibit. Neither did various other digital fever dreams, from some that Agsten described as \u201cdark and apocalyptic\u201d to others that she called \u201csome of our absolutely most radical depictions\u201d of a future Los Angeles.*\n\n>*I know just enough about artificial intelligence to be worried \u2014 but not enough to know how worried I should be.*\n\n>*In the hands of Google and Meta, the technology\u00a0threatens the news business, by taking journalism produced by people like me and handing it out for free (after occasionally mangling it to the point where it\u2019s no longer accurate). The data centers that power AI consume\u00a0huge amounts of energy and water.\u00a0Also bad: Liars can use AI to create images that distort reality for nefarious ends, such as tricking people into thinking that national parks have been\u00a0overrun by migrant tent camps. (They have not.)*\n\n>*So why turn to potentially dystopian tech to envision a better future? Why not let Smith and her students flex their creativity?*\n\nAgain, I hope you'll read the whole piece and share you're thoughts!

Here's how it starts:\n\n>*In the early morning light, it\u2019s easy to mistake the towering gray mounds for an odd-looking mountain range \u2014 pale and dull and devoid of life, some pine trees and shrublands in the foreground with lazy blue skies extending up beyond the peaks.*\n\n>*But the mounds aren\u2019t mountains.*\n\n>*They\u2019re enormous piles of dirt, torn from the ground by crane-like machines called draglines to open paths to the rich coal seams beneath. And even though we\u2019re in rural southeastern Montana, more than 800 miles from the Pacific Ocean, West Coast cities are largely to blame for the destruction of this landscape.*\n\n>*Workers at the Rosebud Mine load coal onto a conveyor belt, which carries the planet-wrecking fuel to a power plant in the small town next door. Plant operators in Colstrip burn the coal to produce electricity, much of which is shipped by power line to homes and businesses in the Portland and Seattle areas. It\u2019s been that way for decades.*\n\n>*\u201cThe West Coast markets are what created this,\u201d Anne Hedges says, as we watch a dragline move dirt.*\n\n>*She sounds frustrated, and with good reason.*\n\n>*Hedges and her fellow Montana environmentalists were happy when Oregon and Washington passed laws requiring 100% clean energy in the next two decades. But they\u2019re furious that electric utilities in those states are planning to stick with coal for as long as the laws allow, and in some cases making deals to give away their Colstrip shares to co-owners who seem determined to keep the plant running long into the future.*\n\n>*\u201cCoal is not dead yet,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cIt\u2019s still alive and well.\u201d*\n\n>*That\u2019s an uncomfortable reality for West Coasters critical of red-state environmental policies but not in the habit of urging their politicians to work across state lines to change them \u2014 especially when doing so might involve compromise with Republicans.*\n\n>*One example: California lawmakers have*\u00a0[*refused to pass bills*](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2018/09/06/california-approves-100-climate-friendly-energy-punts-other-bills/1204451002/)\u00a0*that would make it easier to share clean electricity across the West, passing up the chance to spur renewable energy development in windy red states such as Montana and Wyoming \u2014 and to show them it\u2019s possible to create construction jobs and tax revenues with renewable energy, not just fossil fuels.*\n\n>*Instead, California has prioritized in-state wind and solar farms, bowing to the will of labor unions that want those jobs.*\n\n>*It\u2019s hard to blame Golden State politicians, and voters, for taking the easy path.*\n\n>*But global warming is a global problem \u2014 and whether we like it or not, the electric grid is a giant, interconnected machine. Coal plants in conservative states help fuel the ever-deadlier heat waves, fires and storms battering California and other progressive bastions. The electrons generated by those plants flow into a network of wires that keep the lights on across the American West.*\n\n>*Also important: Montana and other sparsely populated conservative states control two U.S. Senate seats each, and at least three electoral votes apiece in presidential elections. Additional federal support for clean energy rests partly in their hands.*\n\n>*Those are the practical considerations. Then there are the ethical ones.*\n\nAgain \u2014 that's just the beginning. Really hope you'll read the whole story and tell me what you think!"

                "Content": "In addition to pumping tens of thousands of tons of radioactively contaminated cooling water to the ocean, Japan announced intention to spread around the country as much as 14 million cubic meters of radioactively contaminated soil.\n\nThis reportedly would be for road-building, construction projects, & even agricultural underlayment. In 2023 the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna \u2014 which promotes nuclear reactor industry globally \u2014 declared the plan to disperse waste \u201cis consistent with international safety standards.\u201d\n\nContaminated soil was scraped & removed from farms, school yards, public parks, & green spaces during government attempt to \u201cdecontaminate\u201d thousands of square kilometers around Fukushima-Daiichi site. These millions of bags have been kept in open air for years at 1,000+ \u201ctemporary storage sites.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 there were then 22 million cubic meters of poisoned soil in bags. In 2020 there were 20 million cubic meters, and that by early 2019, collection & bagging waste cost government $27 billion. Fukushima\u2019s cesium fallout contaminated 9,000+ kms\u00b2 of forests, farmland & residential areas.\n\nA report warned, \u201cNo decontamination activities are planned for majority of forested areas, covering 75% of the main contaminated area. Outdoor workers in the special decontamination zone (1,117 kms\u00b2) may as a group be exposed to more than the government\u2019s long-term suggested limit of radiation.\u201d\n\nTo make way for the public\u2019s acceptance of spreading radioactivity in civic works and agriculture, the government has increased 80x the \u201callowable\u201d level of cesium in the collected soil to be employed, and new 8,000 Bq/kg goes \u201cagainst their own recommendations,\u201d \u201cMy fear is that once they relax this rule, they can then go on and ease all sorts of other rules,\u201d\n\nTwice already Japan has significantly weakened radiation exposure standards after the triple meltdowns. Government increased the permitted radiation dose to infants, children & adults by 20 times. In 2023 it reduced from 64 to 30 the number of radioactive materials it measures in seawater outside the Fukushima radioactive wastewater release pipe.\n\nTokyo tested use of some contaminated soil in farm fields, \u201cwhere \\[radioactive\\] soil was covered with normal soil & used to raise ground level.\u201d Rain moving through cesium-contaminated soil will move this long-lived radioactive waste into groundwater.\n\nThe cesium-contaminated soil should be containerized and kept out of the environment for up to 300 years (after which the cesium has decays to other elements). But the government has arbitrarily decided that a certain amount of contamination will be permitted in spite of the risks posed to handlers, transport works, nearby residents and to surface and ground water.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lddkxuryv32j](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3lddkxuryv32j)"

Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emission reductions per dollar. Second, it takes about a decade to build a nuclear plant.

This timeline is incompatible with the urgent demands of climate science.\u201d\n\nEDIT: hard data on cost of various energies, nuclear is very expensive aside from also being dangerous and having a limited uranium supply and being uninsurable by any private insurer without taxpayer support. \u00a0https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf"

                "Content": ">Nuclear energy is valuable for the base load though and can help remove gas and coal powered plants.\n\nBaseload is an outdated concept from the time when thermal plants were the cheapest. Grid operators would try to minimize the cost of electricity production by identifying the minimum consumption at any time (the baseload) and fill that up with constantly producing thermal plants. Then they would use flexible power (hydro, gas, etc.) to fill up the rest of the demand curve.\n\nThat makes clear that replacing fossil baseload with nuclear baseload will not reduce the need for gas or other flexible power. \n\nWorse, it doesn't even achieve the goal of making the electricity as cheap as possible, because nuclear is among the most expensive electricity sources.\n\nSo the ideal electricity provision right now is using as many renewables as possible, and then fill up the rest of the curve with flexible generation, preferably hydro, and then gas if we have to until renewable gas or storage is available."

And about half the price of nuclear is financial cost, so having state loan (3%) instead of public load (10%) is going to massively impact the total price of nuclear. So the more we build nuclear, the less it costs, exponentially.\n\n>Nuclear energy is one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity.

Should be stop to use hydro? Of course not, then why should nuclear, which is safer, be excluded?\n\n>We have learned how to manage grids with high proportions of renewable sources.\n\nIf that was true, then why Germany is not considered a huge success?

                "Content": "Is RTE the ultimate authority? Its a political organisation supporting the political goals of the French state. The French independent state auditor (The Cour des Comptes) has been very critical of the costs of new nuclear. RTE and EDF were wrong about the cost of Flammanville and have a vested interest in nuclear energy, their word is not gospel.\n\nBesides, French is in a unique position. It considers nuclear power as part of their cultural heritage. It has a huge domestic nuclear sector. It has a nuclear weapons programme. Nuclear technology are a corner stone of their foreign policy. Even if we assume that nuclear is affordable in France, dispite them not having build a nuclear plant in 40 years and the one they are trying to build being way over budget and schedule, than that doesnt mean the same can be said in general, it only means it works in a niche market.\n\n>That\u2019s absolutely true, but if you look at the big picture why is nuclear having the lowest number of death per TWh?\u00a0\n\nFor the same reason we were told Tabacco is harmless. It's very hard to prove causality between a death and radation, there might be 30 years or more between being exposed to radiation and symptoms revealing themselves. Nuclear is also known for being secretive. Estimates of death per TWh vary widely for those reasons. It's also worth noting the many close calls we have had, had we been a bit less lucky those numbers would be vastly different (recent examples being Zaporizhzhia NPP and Noto Peninsula Earthquake).\n\n>If that was true, then why Germany is not considered a huge success?\n\nThat is just fossil fuel propaganda. For all intents and purposes Germany is a huge success. It has slashed its reliance on Russia and his environmental footprint, while experiencing massive economic growth. Germany is building renewables a lot quicker than France ever build nuclear power. Germany even bailed out France when its nuclear power plants were plagued by many technical issues in 2022-23.\n\nSure, the Energiewende is barely 10 years old and the work is not completed yet, but its a big success already having slashed emmission by over 50%. In the same period Germany couldnt have build a single nucear power plant and does a nuclear route would not have reduced any emissions.\n\n>That being said solar/wind/nuclear are not ennemies.\n\nI agree they are just technologies without emotions, however the evidence is overwhelming that intermittent and inflexible (or \"baseload\") energy sources dont mix well. This is why not just nuclear but all baseload plants are being closed as intermittent sources grow, baseload plants just become uneconomic if they only make money for short periods of time. Outside of France there are barely any baseload plants left operating in Western Europe for this reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting the many politicians using nuclear power as an excuse to slow down or halt the building of renewables, for example French nationalists and Australian conservatives calling on a halt on renewables and to shift resources to nuclear power, which at best causes a 15 year delay to the energy transition. Oppertunity costs are real.\n\nWether your grid is designed around baseload plants or intermittent plants, you need dispatchable sources to fill the gaps. To do so without fossil fuel is the main challange grid designers face today."

President Biden's platform was shaped by Senator Sanders. it included The Green New Deal. unfortunately, it was sabotaged by, not only the GOP, but the DNC. two senators played the fool, claiming to be centrists wanting partisan unification, while the rest of the party claimed that they genuinely wanted it to pass. POTUS basically did nothing to throw his weight around to get it passed. he has refused to declare it a national emergency, despite far less having been qualified.\n\nwe are supposed to be represented in government by public servants. the large majority of people - in some cases a super majority - want more to be done about climate change. so please tell me again how we are to blame."

If they do decomposition is through aerobic metabolism, and the waste product is carbon dioxide. In a trash heap, the oxygen is quickly used up and the microbes who have metabolism without oxygen take over doing anaerobic decomposition. The byproduct from that process is not carbon dioxide CO2 but methane CH4  otherwise known as natural gas or cow burps. \n\nMolecule for molecule, methane is a far more powerful agent of global warming then carbon dioxide.\n\nSo the message in this post is we can take a huge bite out of emissions if people stop putting compostable organic matter in the trash, where it will be turned mostly to methane, and instead put it in the compost or some collection process where it will be turned into mostly carbon dioxide. \n\n\u201cOn a 100-year timescale, methane has 28 times greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide and is 84 times more potent on a 20-year timescale.\u201d [Source](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/carbon-management-and-fossil-fuels/methane-emissions_en)"

And that assumes a free supply of CO2...\n\nThen combine that with the efficiency of a petrol engine which is about 20% on average and you have a combined efficiency of less than 10% of your renewable energy being turned into kinetic energy of the vehicle.\n\nFor EVs, that efficiency from \"well to wheel\" is 70-80%\n\nE-fuels are an absurd waste of clean energy and should be consigned to only the most niche applications."

So I guess the argument arises when people fundamentally disagree with whether we are in overshoot or have crossed boundaries, or imagine God will save us. Meanwhile, I'm reading \"Don't Even Think About It - Why Our Minds Are Wired To Ignore Climate Change.\" Wired means hardwired, ie unchangeable. Darwinism simply did not evolve us to predict and prevent the collapse of complex societies, as evidenced by the 80 that already came and went - let alone climate change, the most wicked problem of all. As E. O. Wilson put it: \u201cThe real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology.\"\n\nThen when one adds all the other existential risks and damage done, baked-in cooking of the planet, well. Add a knowledge of the aforementioned areas of my previous post, and it spells doom.\n\nNot necessarily next year or decade, but sooner or later. And not necessarily the extinction of mankind; I reckon that's unlikely. But perhaps a return to hunter & gatherer life, after sea levels have risen 65 meters and rare metals are all used up, if our insects don't disappear entirely and the oceans aren't dead and stuff like that. One could go on. Here's a few more.\n\nTry running a Monte Carlo simulation of a 1% risk per annum of a nuclear exchange, and see how far we tend to get. I'll wait. How do we escape the harm of media and social media, humankind's biggest experiment we stumbled into? No clue, it's just getting worse. Deepfakes will accelerate it. One cannot function living in separate realities. Jevon's paradox is a fundamental truism of human nature; we'd need a paradigm shift about that alone, fifty years ago. What will a migrant crisis a thousand times bigger do to geopolitics?  Imagine adding more and more stressors to our current world. Try to assess the probability of avoiding all tipping points A tipping point is a tipping point. Predict how the developing world will grow in consumption, how our population will grow, and how our energy use will grow. Power corrupts; even neuroscience is confirming that, not that we needed to. What's on the other side of the US' debt crisis and the unavoidable forfeiture? A very big wall? Will we invent the CSS we need? It's not impossible. It's also not guaranteed.\n\nIt's not pessimism, it's realism. It just looks like it, until one understands enough of the predicament. Then one sees, and cannot unsee.

There's no timeframe and therefore no indication of whether it would happen on current trajectury for this century.\n\n\n\"What the study doesn\u2019t do, however, is give timeframes for a potential collapse. More research is needed, van Westen told CNN, including models which also mimic climate change impacts, such as increasing levels of planet-heating pollution, which this study did not.\"\n\n\n\"Modern data shows the AMOC\u2019s strength fluctuates, but there is no observed evidence yet of a decline, Hirschi said. \u201cWhether abrupt changes in the AMOC similar to those seen in the past will occur as our climate continues to warm is an important open question.\u201d\"\n\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/09/climate/atlantic-circulation-collapse-weather-climate/index.html\n\n>heating has breached our own self imposed limits\n\n\nMost climate models don\u2019t expect actual warming to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030s. The 1.5C and 2C warming thresholds have been defined in terms of the trend line. Not individual years.\n\n\nProposed method for determining long-term average for a given year is taking an average of previous 10/15 years and the following 10/15 years. We know that the average for current year is 1.2-1.3c from data from previous 10 years and projections for the next 10 years.\n\n\n\"reaching 1.5c of warming\" in climate science is not defined as 1 year being above 1.5c. It has always been defined as 20 or 30-year average for a year being above that. 20- or 30- year average was chosen because longer period over which the average is measured provides more accurate estimates. It paints the most realistic picture of actual warming, that's why it was chosen it the first place. 5 or 10-year average would be more sensitive to multi-year fluctuations and therefore less accurate.\n\n\n\"The widely available global average temperature for a specific year isn't a suitable indicator for determining if the \"Paris 1.5\" threshold has been surpassed. The Paris Agreement focuses on long-term warming trends rather than yearly fluctuations. However, there has not been a formally agreed-upon alternative approach established yet.\n\n\n\"Clarity on breaching the Paris Agreement guard rails will be crucial. Without an agreement on what actually will count as exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C, we risk distraction and confusion at precisely the time when action to avoid the worst effects of climate change becomes even more urgent.\"-\n\n\nRichard A. Betts MBE, Study Lead Author and Head, Climate Impacts Research, Met Office Hadley Center\n\n\n\"Betts says, \u201cUsing the average global temperature over the last 20 years would mean we would have to wait ten years to confirm whether the 1.5 \u00b0C ceiling has been reached: creating a decade of otherwise preventable delay. Today we are recommending an indicator combining the last ten years of global temperature observations with an estimate of the projection or forecast for the next ten years. If adopted, this could mean a universally agreed measure of global warming that could trigger immediate action to avoid further rises.\u201d\n\n\nThe scientists found that the figure for the current global warming level is around 1.26 \u00b0C using this recommended approach, with an uncertainty range of 1.13 \u00b0C to 1.43 \u00b0C.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=34347\n\n\n\"All methods with all datasets put current warming around 1.2C to 1.3C\"\n\n\nnitter.perennialte.ch/richardabetts/status/1732849860582187039#m\n\n\n\"A single year above 1.5C (or 2C for that matter) would not mean that the world has passed that temperature target. Given the warming rate of 0.2C per decade since 1970, and the fact that a super El Nino event can add up to 0.2C to a specific year\u2019s global temperatures through natural variability, it is possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases does.Because of this, we should be a bit cautious about how we interpret the first year passing 1.5C (whether it happens in 2023, 2024, or later)! Most models don\u2019t expect the longer term average to pass 1.5C until the early-to-mid 2030s, but we do expect many individual years to pass 1.5C before then.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/will-2023-be-the-first-year-above\n\n\nhttps://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/08/we-are-not-reaching-1-5oc-earlier-than-previously-thought/\n\n\nNitter.perennialte.ch/hausfath/status/1667206122594525184\n\n\n\"The 1.5C and 2C warming thresholds have been defined in terms of the trend line. Not individual years, let alone months, weeks, or days (the shorter the time period, the larger the random fluctuations). Those who imply otherwise are misleading you. We are talking about the average state of the system. ...That is how the impacts have been defined, so that is implicit in the definition of 1.5C (or 2C) as danger thresholds--those thresholds are tied to specific impacts that happen at those levels of average warming\"\n\n\nnitter.perennialte.ch/MichaelEMann/status/1726627380968686017"

And neither does Second Thought. He just explains context. Which liberals don't like.\n\nIn Ukraine, both the U.S. and Russia are at fault.\nBut it's mostly Americans who I interact with and who are the most ignorant of the nature of the empire that the US operates.\n\nPut me in touch with some pro Putin Russians and I'll happily tell them why Putin is a gangster and a warmonger. But as above, at a global scale, no country comes close to the US when it comes to causing wars, instability, authoritarian rule and general mayhem.\n\nAs gor persuading American liberals, tbh they are usually only useful only insofar as they demonstrate perfectly the lack of seriousness and imagination of people who have been most successfully indoctrinated into a neoliberal capitalist ideology. \n\nLiberals are usually to comfortable with the status quo to really challenge it, or to even listen out a substantive critique of it.\n\nThey don't care about manufacturing consent. They don't care about material or class analysis. They think that capitalism is a law of nature. They think that all the problems of the world are caused by bad individuals, never bad systems and structures. They are incurious about thinking outside the hegemonic common sense of managed democracy under neoliberal capitalism. And when it comes to politicians and parties, they usually think that so long as you're better than the other guy then you deserve undying loyalty. \n\nIt's impossible to get most of these people to move left. They hate the left more than they hate conservatives."

It may end up being much more feasible than large expensive facilities.  I\u2019ve often thought that some form of low-energy passive carbon capture in furnaces/air conditioners has potential because we\u2019re already using energy to move the air for other purposes.  But of course, just like with the car, you\u2019ve got to be able to capture, hold, and ultimately sequester the carbon for it to be useful.

        "Content": "I chat about a recent peer-reviewed scientific paper that examines how Kinetic Energy (the energy of motion) is transferred (cascades) from the atmospheric winds to the ocean surface eddy currents to large scale ocean gyres and finally to global atmospheric circulation patterns which include the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; including Gulf Stream) and PMOC (Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation; including Kuroshio Current).\n\nThis energy transfer across increasingly large scales contributes large amounts of energy to power the global overturning ocean circulation.\n\nArticle: \u201cScientists uncover link between ocean weather and global climate, using mechanical rather than statistical analysis\u201d: https://phys.org/news/2023-12-scientists-uncover-link-ocean-weather.html\n\n\u201cThe ocean has weather patterns like what we experience on land, but on different time and length scales, says lead author Benjamin Storer, a research associate in Aluie's Turbulence and Complex Flow Group. A weather pattern on land might last a few days and be about 500 kilometers wide, while oceanic weather patterns such as swirling eddies last three to four weeks but are about one-fifth the size.\n\n\"Scientists have long speculated that these ubiquitous and seemingly random motions in the ocean communicate with climate scales, but it has always been vague because it wasn't clear how to disentangle this complex system to measure their interactions,\" says Aluie. \"We developed a framework that can do exactly that. What we found was not what people were expecting because it requires the mediation of the atmosphere.\"\n\nArticle: \u201cHow Ocean Currents Work (and How We Are Breaking Them)\u201d: https://www.pbs.org/video/how-ocean-currents-work-and-how-we-are-breaking-them-zi2ntj/\n\nGlobal Atmospheric Circulation System: https://www.google.ca/search?q=global+atmospheric+circulation+system&sca_esv=601619779&tbm=isch&source=hp&ei=FzazZZ6_LsWj5NoPhvWo2Ak&oq=global+atmos&gs_lp=EhJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWciDGdsb2JhbCBhdG1vcyoCCAAyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjJLFCjCFibIXAAeACQAQCYAU-gAdUGqgECMTK4AQHIAQD4AQGoAgDCAgQQABgDwgIOEAAYgAQYigUYsQMYgwHCAggQABiABBixAw&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img\n\nPeer-reviewed scientific study: \u201cOCEANOGRAPHYGlobalcascadeof kineticenergyin the ocean and the atmospheric imprint\u201d: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi7420\n\n\u201cThe study revealed that ocean weather systems are both energized and weakened when interacting with climate scales, and in a pattern that mirrors the global atmospheric circulation. The researchers also found that an atmospheric band near the equator called the \"intertropical convergence zone,\" which produces 30% of global precipitation, causes an intense amount of energy transfer, and produces ocean turbulence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbstract\n\nHere, we present an estimate for the ocean's global scale transfer of kinetic energy (KE), across scales from 10 to 40,000 km. Oceanic KE transfer between gyre scales and mesoscales is induced by the atmosphere\u2019s Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells, and the intertropical convergence zone induces an intense downscale KE transfer. Upscale transfer peaks at 300 gigawatts across mesoscales of 120 km in size, roughly one-third the energy input by winds into the oceanic general circulation. Nearly three quarters of this \u201ccascade\u201d occurs south of 15\u00b0S and penetrates almost the entire water column. The mesoscale cascade has a self-similar seasonal cycle with characteristic lag time of \u224827 days per octave of length scales; transfer across 50 km peaks in spring, while transfer across 500 km peaks in summer. KE of those mesoscales follows the same cycle but peaks \u224840 days after the peak cascade, suggesting that energy transferred across a scale is primarily deposited at a scale four times larger.\u201d\n\nPlease donate to http://PaulBeckwith.net to support my research and videos connecting the dots on abrupt climate system mayhem.",

Coal is *significantly* worse for most emissions. Natural gas emits \\~50% less Co2 than coal. When we already have the infrastructure, domestic resources, and political will in place to utilize natural gas, it's a really obvious step to take to get us off of coal while we work to expand the infrastructure and political will to adapt even cleaner power sources. It's one of the key ways US emissions have been reduced in the past decade.

        "Content": "Many years ago, I originated the phrase \u201cBlue-Ocean Event\u201d for an essentially ice-free Arctic.\n\nWe can expect to see this any year now. As there is less and less sea-ice in the Arctic, there are now more and more \u201cMarine Heat Waves\u201d MHW events occurring along the outer edges of the Arctic Ocean, expanding in size to deeper waters, extending to longer and longer durations (103 days in 2020), and increasing to hotter and hotter Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) (4C in 2020).\n\nI chat about the most recent science on the Arctic Sea Ice and these Arctic Marine Heat Waves.\n\nMore information on articles and peer reviewed papers; all open source\u2026\n\n1) \u201cThe Arctic could become 'ice-free' within a decade, say scientists\u201d\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-03-arctic-ice-free-decade-scientists.html\n\n2) \u201cFrequent marine heat waves in the Arctic Ocean will be the norm, says new study\u201d\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-02-frequent-marine-arctic-ocean-norm.html\n\n3) \u201cProjections of an ice-free Arctic Ocean\u201d\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-023-00515-9.pdf\n\n\u201cAbstract\nObserved Arctic sea ice losses are a sentinel of anthropogenic climate change. These reductions are projected to continue with ongoing warming, ultimately leading to an ice-free Arctic (sea ice area less than 1 million\u2009 km2). In this Review, we synthesize understanding of the timing and regional variability of such an ice-free Arctic. In the September monthly mean, the earliest ice-free conditions (the first single occurrence of an ice-free Arctic) could occur in 2020\u20132030s under all emission trajectories and are likely to occur by 2050. However, daily September ice-free conditions are expected approximately 4\u2009years earlier on average, with the possibility of preceding monthly metrics by 10\u2009years. Consistently ice-free September conditions (frequent occurrences of an ice-free Arctic) are anticipated by mid-century (by 2035\u20132067), with emission trajectories determining how often and for how long the Arctic could be ice free. Specifically, there is potential for ice-free conditions in May\u2013January and August\u2013October by 2100 under a high-emission and low-emission scenario, respectively. In all cases, sea ice losses begin in the European Arctic, proceed to the Pacific Arctic and end in the Central Arctic, if becoming ice free at all. Future research must assess the impact of model selection and recalibration on projections, and assess the drivers of internal variability that can cause early ice-free conditions.\u201d\n\n4) \u201cArctic marine heatwaves forced by greenhouse gases and triggered by abrupt sea-ice melt\u201d\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01215-y.pdf\n\n\u201cAbstract\nSince 2007, unprecedented marine heatwave events are occurring over the Arctic Ocean. Here we identify the fraction of the likelihood of Arctic marine heatwaves magnitude that is attributable to greenhouse gas forcing. Results reveal that Arctic marine heatwaves are primarily triggered by an abrupt sea-ice retreat, which coincides with the maximum downward radiative fluxes. Up to 82% of the sea surface temperature variability over the shallow Arctic marginal seas, where marine heatwaves are prone to occur, can be explained by net accumulation of seasonal surface heat flux in the ocean. Event attribution analysis demonstrates that the 103-day long 2020 event \u2013 the most intense (4\u2009\u2218C) recorded so far in the Arctic \u2013 would be exceptionally unlikely in the absence of greenhouse gas forcing in terms of both intensity and duration. Our further results imply that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, along with the expansion of first-year ice extent, moderate marine heatwaves in the Arctic will very likely persistently reoccur.\u201d\n\nPlease donate to http://PaulBeckwith.net to support my research and videos joining the dots on abrupt climate system mayhem.",

                "Content": "Let's see what the paper is about, because the clickbait title sound like clickbait.\n\n>How UA compares with conventional agriculture depends on the crops grown, growing systems and local climate3. It is unclear what forms of UA are environmentally friendly, because case studies of individual cities typically only assess one form of UA\n\nThis just sounds like they're discovering the problem of \"locavore\" footprint. Meaning that eating locally doesn't guarantee lower GHG emissions because the production processes can be more energy intensive or polluting than transportation from a place where those production processes are way less energy intensive and polluting.\n\n>Collective gardens are the most carbon-intensive form of UA (\u03bc\u2009=\u20090.81\u2009kgCO2e per serving, 7.50\u2009kgCO2e\u2009kg\u22121). Individual gardens and urban farms are similar on average (both produce 0.34\u2009kgCO2e per serving), but variation among urban farms leaves them statistically indistinguishable from conventional farms (P\u2009=\u20090.33). In fact, most urban farms are carbon-competitive with conventional farms (median\u2009=\u20090.08\u2009kgCO2e per serving when one particularly carbon-intensive urban farm is excluded from the analysis)\n\nIt's likely a measure of community resource investment with poor planning. Let's see.\n\n>Nonetheless, the average vegetable at the local grocer outperforms the average vegetable on UA sites in all five countries (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nProbably because professionals know how to produce more with less and reach economies of scale. \n\n>For example, the median urban tomato (0.17\u2009kgCO2e per serving) outperforms conventional tomatoes (\u03bc\u2009=\u20090.27\u2009kgCO2e per serving). Although, on average, urban tomatoes are more carbon-intensive than conventional tomatoes (P\u2009=\u20090.02), this low median demonstrates that UA sites often outperform conventional tomato growing. This is largely due to the carbon-intensive greenhouses that supply most tomatoes to our case cities, as well as sub-optimal distribution patterns of the crop from farm to city\n\nif you're growing tomatoes in an open garden, it means that you can grow tomatoes outside and you get free zero-carbon energy from the Sun. Such comparisons should not be made in the first place.\n\n>This suggests that urban food growers could maximize carbon benefits (or minimize carbon impacts) by selecting crops conventionally grown or distributed using carbon-intensive methods. \n\nYes, that's actually the case where transportation emissions are way worse.\n\n> Urban farms are most likely to be climate-friendly (43% of urban farm sites), followed by individual gardens (25% of sites).\n\nthe professionals win. I'm shocked.\n\n>neither environmental actions (for example, presence of solar panels) nor expressed values are predictive of carbon emissions (Supplementary Table 3)\n\nthis isn't a \"fake it till you make it\" situation.\n\n>We identify three best practices crucial to making low-tech UA carbon-competitive with conventional agriculture: (1) extend infrastructure lifetimes, (2) use urban waste as inputs and (3) generate high levels of social benefits.\n\nAll 3 are tied to professional/commercial efforts. Knowing how to build a long-lasting farm is part of a plan. Connecting urban waste and handling it also requires some extra means and know-how. Social benefits means especially that the harvest isn't just for a small minority, which also displaces supply from other sources.\n\n>Infrastructure is the largest driver of carbon emissions at low-tech UA sites (63% of impacts)\n\nYep. You can't use farms like sandboxes.\n\n>The carbon footprint of compost grows tenfold when methane-generating anaerobic conditions persist in compost piles39. This is common during small-scale composting, and home compost is the highest-impact input on 22 of the 73 UA sites studied (Supplementary Table 4). Cities can offset this risk by centralizing compost operations for professional management or by training farmers on proper composting practices\n\nKnowledge. (Otherwise, the compost bin is like the rumen of a cow.) \n\n>Instead, sites primarily used potable municipal water sources or groundwater wells, consistent with the underutilization of rainwater seen across past research9. Irrigation from these sources emits GHGs from pumping, water treatment and distribution, and this rose to as high as 83% of total emissions on one UA site\n\n*points at MULCHING IS OBLIGATORY sign*\n\n>UA practitioners overwhelmingly reported improved mental health, diets and social networks.\n\nIndeed, it's very nice.\n\n>This study takes a conservative approach by allocating all supplies and irrigation to food production, and infrastructure is allocated to food and social co-benefits based on interviews with farmers and standardized calculations (for example, 10% of a raised bed allocated to non-food if 10% of the area grows ornamentals).\n\nThat's fair. The only ornamental plants that should be used are the ones that can be mixed in to help, such as those that attract pollinators, spiders and so on.\n\n>Although this threshold appears high, evidence suggests this is attainable. Cost\u2013benefit analysis of a collective garden in the UK estimated that social benefits, such as improved well-being and reduced hospital admissions, accounted for 99.4% of total economic value generated on-site47. Because emissions allocation often follows economic value generation46, growing spaces that maximize social benefits can outcompete conventional agriculture when UA benefits are considered holistically.\n\nIndeed. They're describing the benefit of a type of park. Don't call it a farm, call it a \"food park\" or \"garden park\". \n\nThis paper is useless, it's not even comparing apples to oranges."
