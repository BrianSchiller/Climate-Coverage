                "Content": "Zo\u00eb Schlanger: \u201cAs Hurricane Milton exploded from a Category 1 storm into a Category 5 storm over the course of 12 hours yesterday, climate scientists and meteorologists were stunned. NBC6\u2019s John Morales, a veteran TV meteorologist in South Florida, choked up on air while describing how quickly and dramatically the storm had intensified. To most people, a drop in pressure of 50 millibars means nothing; a weatherman understands, as Morales said mid-broadcast, that \u2018this is just horrific.\u2019 Florida is still cleaning up from Helene; this storm is spinning much faster, and it\u2019s more compact and organized.\n\n\u201cIn a way, Milton is exactly the type of storm that scientists have been warning could happen; Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, called it shocking but not surprising. \u2018One of the things we know is that, in a warmer world, the most intense storms are more intense,\u2019 he told me. Milton might have been a significant hurricane regardless, but every aspect of the storm that could have been dialed up has been.\n\n\u201cA hurricane forms from multiple variables, and in Milton, the variables have come together to form a nightmare. The storm is gaining considerable energy thanks to high sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which is far hotter than usual. And that energy translates into higher wind speeds. Milton is also taking up moisture from the very humid atmosphere, which, as a rule, can hold 7 percent more water vapor for every degree-Celsius increase in temperature. Plus, the air is highly unstable and can therefore rise more easily, which allows the hurricane to form and maintain its shape. And thanks to La Ni\u00f1a, there isn\u2019t much wind shear\u2014the wind\u2019s speed and direction are fairly uniform at different elevations\u2014\u2018so the storm can stay nice and vertically stacked,\u2019 Kim Wood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona, told me. \u2018All of that combined is making the storm more efficient at using the energy available.\u2019 In other words, the storm very efficiently became a major danger \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMilton is also a very compact storm with a highly symmetrical, circular core, Wood said. In contrast, Helene\u2019s core took longer to coalesce, and the storm stayed more spread out. Wind speeds inside Milton picked up by about 90 miles an hour in a single day, intensifying faster than any other storm on record besides Hurricanes Wilma in 2005 and Felix in 2007. Climate scientists have worried for a while now that climate change could produce storms that intensify faster and reach higher peak intensities, given an extra boost by climate change. Milton is doing just that.\u201d\n\nRead more here: [https://theatln.tc/kyWsw7AN](https://theatln.tc/kyWsw7AN)\u00a0"

She\u2019s been a driving force in delivering the strongest climate action in history, and she\u2019s ready to build on those gains from day one as president.\n  \nTwo years ago this summer, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote that secured U.S. Senate passage\nof the strongest climate action in history \u2013 climate and clean energy incentives worth at least $370 billion over 10 years in the Inflation Reduction Act. She has also been a driving force to ensure that the solutions are equitable and address the unfair pollution and health burdens that our nation\u2019s front-line communities have suffered.\n  \nHarris has worked for environmental justice for two decades, starting after she was elected district attorney for San Francisco and, later, attorney general for California. She created one of the first environmental justice units in San Francisco and held oil companies and automakers accountable for their pollution.\n  \nFormer President Trump, on the other hand, waged the worst White House attack ever against\nthe environment and public health while in office. And he has made clear that his second term will be even more extreme, drawing from the detailed anti-environment proposals and plans contained in Project 2025. Every vote for Dr. Jill Stein or Cornel West instead of Kamala Harris makes it more likely that Donald Trump will win.\n  \nWe share your commitment to a safe and healthy environment for all and thank Stein and West\nfor raising important issues in this election, but Vice President Harris is the only candidate with a\nrecord of success addressing climate change. Please join us in voting for the Harris-Walz ticket and against the Trump-Vance pro-polluter ticket.\n  \nSincerely,  \n350 Action  \nCenter for Biological Diversity Action Fund  \nClimate Emergency Advocates  \nEarthjustice Action  \nFood and Water Action  \nFriends of the Earth Action  \nLeague of Conservation Voters  \nNRDC Action Fund  \nSierra Club  \nSunrise Movement"

You are never going to be able to vote the revolution in, but you can do harm reduction while working toward more independent means of securing progressive action, such as mutual aid. Independent action which will be far easier to organize under a bunch of status quo imperialist neolibs than actively fascist and hostile ones I might add. Leftists won't have the time or energy to make actual progress and will be stuck in a place of trying to protect as many people as possible from Project2025 if Trump gets in.\n> \n> People already tried to make a statement by voting for the Greens or abstaining in 2000 making the race close enough that the republicans could steal it through the supreme court (which is now far more aligned with the republicans than it was then) for Bush Jr. A result that lead to the \"War on Terror\" destabilizing the region and having a pretty big impact on the issues occurring over there currently.\n>"

Staying home or voting for any candidate other than Kamala Harris means passing up your one opportunity to preserve our green policies that were won against very difficult odds. \n\nIf Kamala Harris loses, we'll have a president who hates the IRA and wants to repeal it, has already withdrawn from the Paris agreement once and will do it again, who will appoint right-wing judges to every vacancy (including one likely vacancy on the Supreme Court in addition to the three justices he's already appointed), who has no respect for the rule of law or limits on presidential powers, and has a demonstrated ability to rope Congress and the courts into allowing his nonsense. Bad for the country in general, and especially bad for the climate."

Our public utility board is elected, the majority of the board are up for reelection in 2024 (3/5 members). It currently has a republican majority (4/5) who voted to gut energy efficiency rules, eliminate our renewable energy standard, and raise prices for consumers on rooftop solar.\u00a0\n\nWe have three candidates, if elected, who would reverse the trend, foster more renewable energy, phase out coal, and give ratepayers relief from rate increases. They have been campaigning hard, building connections across communities in our state, and stand a reasonable chance of getting elected. We need all three elected. If we just get one or two, there will be no climate change mitigation for Arizona.\u00a0\n\nAnd then we have the greens\u2026\u00a0\n\nThe Green Party, despite having a race with three open seats, fielded two candidates. Their campaigns have been absolutely non-serious. They have not had campaign events, they did not provide candidate statements through Arizona Clean Elections mailers, they did not provide cover photos, they did not set up a website. What they did do is set up a Facebook page one month before the election. The content mentions climate change as an important issue, then talks about Gaza and Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine, issues that resonate with progressives, but have nothing to do with public utility regulation.\u00a0\n\nMy fear is that all the get out the vote efforts will lead to more green votes, causing republicans to get the plurality and win the election. People will see a Facebook post with nice statements, and vote for a choice designed to redirect them from supporting serious candidates who will make meaningful contributions if elected.\u00a0\n\nDo not vote green. No politician ever acted the way you wanted because you made a protest vote. A vote for green is a vote for big oil, fracking, and indefinite coal use. They are an absolute mess, run completely non-serious campaigns designed to tip elections in favor of fossil fuel candidates, and a complete disaster for climate.\u00a0"

As VP, Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote to pass it. And as a result, the country has vastly stepped up its progress in abandoning fossil fuels. \n\nTrump has vowed to kill the IRA, the core of America's climate-change agenda. If he can't kill it, he'll use the power of the presidency to undermine it. And if his first term is any guide, he will sabotage plenty of other environmental protections, and do everything he can to promote fossil fuels.\n\nThe only way these environmental protections stay in place is if Kamala Harris is elected. Staying home or voting for any other candidate is effectively a vote for a hotter planet."

They did this because climate stabilization means bringing fossil fuel use to approximately zero, and that would end their business.  That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.\n\nThere is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                "Content": "The Atlantic Ocean Circulation is an important system of ocean currents. It transports warm water, carbon and nutrients north via the Atlantic Ocean where the water cools and sinks into the deep.\n\nThis helps to distribute energy around the planet, moving heat through the ocean like a conveyor belt and regulating our climate.\n\nWarm water - more salty due to evaporation - flows north on the surface of the ocean keeping Europe milder than it would otherwise be. When this water cools it sinks because its high salinity increases its density. It then flows back to the southern hemisphere along the bottom of the ocean.\n\nBut studies of past episodes of dramatic cooling in Europe over the last 100,000 years suggest melting ice sheets could weaken the AMOC due to changes in salinity and temperature.\n\nFresh water reduces the saltiness - and therefore the density of the water- on the surface of the ocean. This means less of the surface water sinks, potentially slowing the flow of the current."

And it's the winters that will get cold in that scenario, not the whole year.\n- The big risk for Europe is drought / aridification.\n- The unknown risk is that there's going to be a region with very cold air on one side and very warm air on the other, like a corridor or \"belt\" as Americans love to call it.

                "Content": "Financial markets prefer constant returns. This preference is especially prominent in large institutional investors such as pension funds. See [_'Yes, Short-Termism Really Is A Problem'_ in the _Harvard Business Review_.](https://hbr.org/2015/10/yes-short-termism-really-is-a-problem)\n\nThe game that executives must play is to ensure their firms perform in the ~~long~~ medium-term, while demonstrating continuously to financial markets that their stock price will only raise in the short-term, such that investors will continue to own the stock. If enough investors sell the stock so much that its price heavily depreciates, it will cause other investors to sell the stock, further lowering the price in a positive feedback loop. So, without executives continuously engaging investors on financial markets in the short-term, their firm's medium-term performance is of course impossible.\n\nMost issues with green finance right now are due to the unfortunate fact that green assets cannot provide stable enough returns without having already been invested in \u2014 at least, invested in enough to demonstrate that investment in them is required to create green technologies that provide stable returns. For the time being, fossil technology that provides next quarter's returns as expected is a surer investment than green technology, in the short-term. Moreover, green financial assets will not become valuable until everyone wants a piece of them, and nobody wants a piece of them until they are valuable, such that they can be invested in and then sold on to someone else when the time comes to cash in one's returns. Green assets are stuck waiting for someone to make the first painful move, which no private investor wishes to make. This is why governments are eager to invest in green technology \u2014 or at least invest in the certification process that determines which assets are truly 'green', in the hope that motivated investors will invest in those assets regardless of their financial volatility, and thereby kick-start the cycle by which demand raises price which raises demand.\n\nHowever, governments are currently somewhat ham-strung on the green investment front, because doing too much investment will freak out international investors. The investors will make noises about such investment being industrial policy, which gets seen (erroneously) as 'picking winners' that leads to economic inefficiency. Or, the investors will make noises about whether much public investment will cause inflation (erroneously). If they are freaked out enough, investors will disinvest from those governments' currencies, which will tank the exchange rate, which will raise import prices. When that happens, firms realize that everyone's import prices are increasing together, which enables them to co\u00f6rdinate passively to raise prices without having to worry about other firms out-competing them. These price rises are actual inflation. So, there's a self-fulfilling inflationary prophecy that governments have to be very careful about avoiding when they want to invest in green assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the obverse of raised import prices is reduced export prices: if your exchange rate drops, it's easier for foreign firms to buy your exported products. While reduced export prices benefit the dominant exporting firms in an economy, they do not benefit those firms' workers \u2014 unless, in mainstream economic theory, the exports become so popular on the international market that new businesses start up to sell those exported products, which would raise demand for labor in that sector, which would thereby raise wages. But this theoretical situation is rendered quite unlikely in this context, because investors are already running away from holding the currency of the economy in question, which makes financing in the currency rather difficult \u2014 why would I want to invest for returns in a currency I don't want? Furthermore, if inflation has taken off, then the standard-toolkit response by central banks to fight inflation is to raise interest rates, which makes financing new businesses even harder. So, in sum, any upward pressures on wages that might arise in the theoretical situation are neutered, and the only people who benefit from increased exports are firm shareholders and executives. These are also the people who exclusively benefit from whatever price-raising they can passively co\u00f6rdinate above increase import input costs, which is what happened recently when e.g. [Kroger supermarkets raised the prices of milk and eggs above the increase in input costs for those items.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-27/kroger-hiked-milk-egg-prices-above-inflation-merger-judge-told)\n\nAll of this means that the only people who benefit from investors selling a currency in panic are the already-wealthy. The economic divide that this causes, alongside the inflation, causes sociopolitical unrest, as we have seen. This can, as we have also seen, cause a change in political administration. So, in sum, to avoid losing power in political administration, policymakers must avoid scaring international investors. To avoid scaring international investors, policymakers must avoid going heavy and hard on the green investment. Policymakers' reticence to get fully involved on green financing means that the green investment remains at the mercy of private investors. Private investors won't invest in green assets enough already because the assets aren't already promising value, and so would rather wait until the assets have already been invested in.\n\nAnd so we end up with a situation in which nobody will pay to save the world, because there's no money in it."

Getting rid of the feed subsidies so it is more expensive, and better regulating their emissions and waste practices would also naturally curb consumption by increasing the cost of what should be a semi special occasion type of food.\n\nIn addition, moderation and educating on responsible behavior has ALWAYS been more effective when creating change in society.\n\nSaying everyone just needs to be vegetarian is about as good of a sales strategy as an abstinence only education for sex ed."

In essence, their stories teach them nothing useful, and bad times for humans of the Holocene are usually - not exceptionally - abundant in famine, war, disease and all the death tied to those."

Last year, I put my motorbike away in November and I regretted doing so because the weather was so mild that aside from a few weeks I could have ridden my bike the whole year long so this year I decided to test that out.\n\nSo far... I'm still riding despite a few days of snow we had recently. That snow is all gone already! I'm sure we're going to get some more sloppy weather in January and February but if that's it then that's not too bad. 2 months out of the year certainly beats the 6 or 7 I'm accustomed to in terms of riding weather and conditions.\n\nWhen I was a young lad, snowstorms started in October and the snow hills were so big I'd dig tunnels in them and make snow forts. I've never seen my kids do this. The tunnels we made were so big sometimes a full grown adult could stand in them. It boggles my mind that people think global warming is a myth. Do you NOT remember when you were a child what winters were like? I'm 48 btw."

                "Content": "In 2016, Jill Stein helped Donald Trump win the election. She won 132,000 votes in the decisive swing states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania \u2014 while Trump\u2019s margin of victory was just 77,000 votes in those same states. \n  \nWhen confronted about being a spoiler for Trump, [Stein remained unapologetic](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/20/jill-stein-green-party-no-regrets-2016-215281) and said she doesn\u2019t have second thoughts. She has said it\u2019s a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d to be blamed for Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and considers it a \u201c[great honor](https://youtu.be/xbjq0I98Hd8)\u201d to be compared to Ralph Nader and his spoiler campaign. Her campaign surrogates admit she has [no path to victory](https://x.com/keithedwards/status/1843301144577405311) and that their top priority is [stopping Kamala Harris](https://x.com/keithedwards/status/1844109702764036515).\n  \nReporting from The Wall Street Journal and [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/09/23/jill-stein-paid-100000-to-a-consulting-firm-led-by-a-suspected-january-6-rioter/) revealed how the Stein campaign used a Republican consulting firm to help her get on the ballot, and in a recent court case in Nevada, Stein was represented by Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Jay Sekulow. \n  \nStein has had [troubling ties to Vladimir Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696) and her spoiler campaign benefitted from a Russian disinformation campaign in 2016. A [Senate Intelligence Committee](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html) report found that Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein. Additionally, the [Mueller Report](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/30/politics/jill-stein-russia-documents-senate-request/index.html) found that the Kremlin\u2019s Internet Research Agency used social media, including paid Facebook ads, to promote Stein\u2019s candidacy. On June 22, 2024, Trump held a rally in Philadelphia, PA where he said [\u201cJill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them.\u201d](https://www.c-span.org/video/?536453-1/president-trump-holds-rally-philadelphia)"

I also sucked it up and voted for Clinton in 2016. But this impulse to just blame everyone and anyone for the failures of the Democratic Party and HRC is truly maddening. HRC ran one of the worst GenElection campaigns I have ever seen. She came out of a deeply contentious primary with a Policy wonk to her Left; stopped talking substantive policy the moment he dropped out; did absolutely nothing herself to try to consolidate her own base, taking the stance of \"ehh, where else they gonna go?\"; and then spent the VAST majority of the following 3 months courting \"Moderate Republican\" Donors. As she sprinted right as fast as she could the moment Sanders was no longer forcing her left. Then the Dems learned absolutely nothing from it; blaming everything and anything else but themselves for the loss.\n\nThe Dems are a Center Right/Moderate Right Corporate party on everything but a handful of cheap to take stances on Left Leaning ID politics they're never the leaders on. They are certainly better than the alternative, but that bar is so insanely low it is not an accomplishment. On top of this, a Centrist Party beholden to the same donors as the Right Wing Party, only really exist to give more political power to their opposition by-design. By throwing most of their bargaining power away at the door, before the bargaining even begins. While this doctrine of \"Practical Incrementalism\" they preach just falls apart the moment one realizes that the other side have never been Incrementalists. Explaining the consistent, incremental march further to the right for decades on most topics on the Overton Window. To the point \"Feeding School Kids\", \"Climate Change is real\", and \"Codifying Womens rights the nation has gone 50 years backwards on\" is \"Progressive\"?\n\nSo ... Stein sucks.  But screw the Dems for sitting in their comfort space of apparent Dick Cheney levels of Right Wing war criminals now. I'll begrudgingly vote Harris, but I'm not going to sit here and get culty and defensive over a party that absolutely shares accountability for both Trump's successes AND fostering an environment in which \"Trumps\" could thrive. In a two party state, BOTH parties hold accountability for failure of state; while struggling so much to beat Trump of all people only reflects the Dem's weakness.  Plus, I'd guess most voters voting Stein would never have voted Clinton/Harris. They'd probably have stayed home. Lets stop pretending \"those Green votes where the Dem's property\" to avoid holding the Dems accountable for their own failures.  Due to their lack of vision, to tow their own deeply conservative donor lines."

That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.\n\nThere is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                "Content": "Here\u2019s a rundown of why billionaires are often criticized in the context of climate change:\n\n1. Massive Carbon Footprints\n\nPrivate jets, mega-yachts, and multiple large homes contribute disproportionately to global emissions.\n\n\n2. Greenwashing\n\nSome billionaires fund flashy climate initiatives or pledge donations but fail to address the systemic issues their businesses cause.\n\n\n3. Corporate Emissions\n\nMany billionaires own or invest in industries (fossil fuels, mining, deforestation) that are major contributors to climate change.\n\n\n4. Influence Over Policy\n\nThey lobby for deregulation or policies that favor their industries, often at the expense of stricter environmental protections.\n\n\n5. Inefficient Philanthropy\n\nClimate philanthropy often focuses on high-profile, short-term projects rather than long-term systemic solutions.\n\n\n6. Disproportionate Power\n\nTheir wealth enables them to steer global conversations and decisions about climate solutions, sidelining more equitable or community-driven approaches.\n\n\n7. Wealth Hoarding\n\nThe concentration of wealth hinders broader societal investments in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.\n\n\n8. Undermining Public Goods\n\nThey often evade taxes, reducing funds available for public climate initiatives, infrastructure, and R&D in green technologies.\n\n\n9. Focus on Techno-Fixes\n\nPreference for speculative, high-tech solutions (e.g., geoengineering) over simpler, proven strategies like rewilding or energy efficiency.\n\n\n10. Continued Fossil Fuel Investment\n\nMany billionaires continue to invest in or profit from fossil fuel companies despite the urgent need to transition away from them."

They did this because climate stabilization means bringing fossil fuel use to approximately zero, and that would end their business.  That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.\n\nThere is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                "Content": "And rather ironically, a cooling of the North Atlantic would actually result in substantially hotter and drier summers in Western Europe. Various studies demonstrate this so-called cold-ocean-warm-summer feedback, with the more recent Oltmanns, Holliday et al. (2024) study warning that a severely hot and dry summer is imminent in northern and western Europe based on current subpolar SST cooling anomalies. Bischof, Kedzierski et al. (2023) also demonstrated the link between a strong cooling of the North Atlantic and the hot and dry summer of 2018 in the UK, with Rousi, Kornhuber et al. demonstrating the link between cold subpolar SSTs and atmospheric anomalies over northwestern Europe. Similarly, Whan, Zscheischler et al. demonstrate a strong correlation between soil moisture deficits and greater heat anomalies across Europe. Maritime Europe is particularly susceptible to changes in rainfall accumulation and this often results in more intense heatwaves and drought concerns, which create a self-perpetuating feedback based on these metrics. Observations by Schenk, V\u00e4liranta et al. (2018) and Bromley, Putnam et al. (2018) both demonstrated that this higher seasonality response occured during the Younger Dryas event, with Bromley's team demonstrating the warmer summer response in Scotland specifically. Considering that this warmer summer feedback was observable under glacial maximum conditions, it would be fair to assume that a substantial bias for warming would occur should it happen under current conditions.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the severe cooling feedback hypothesis is very out of date. It's based on an idealized preindustrial 1750 baseline of <300ppm and assume a very linear assumption of the hypothetical atmospheric response to changes in thermohaline circulation.  Subsequent atmospheric dynamics are severely underestimated by the current model methodology, with Rahmstorf et al. (2015) discussing this discrepancy in relation to CMIP outputs. Observations by Vautard, Cattiaux et al. demonstrated that warming rates in Western Europe have been disproportionate when compared to computer reconstructions, due to said models not accounting for atmospheric feedbacks. Proxy-based assumptions don't account for factors such as the substantially different conditions of the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interglacial to Younger Dryas reversal analog; the B/A interglacial already saw substantial continental glaciers in Northern Europe and North America - the Fennoscandinavian and Laurentide respectively - and a considerably lower atmospheric carbon volume, which sat around 190-200ppm. These conditions almost certainly exacerbated the cooling response to hypothetical AMOC collapse of that era. But needless to say, these conditions don't apply to the Anthropocene. For all intents and purposes, ~300ppm was the stable threshold for Arctic cryospheric stability, as we hadn't breached 300ppm for 800,000 years prior to industrialization. It was within this period that the Arctic achieved stable year-round glaciation.\n\nAt >420ppm, we're broadly analogous to the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period. Anthropocene albedo forcing continues to crash from its already fatally low levels, with the Arctic region entering a stage where it can no longer advect surplus heat efficiently. Factors such as darkening ice are already initiating an accelerative feedback and Arctic marine heatwave anomalies are being sustained by greenhouse gas forcing. Present atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are more conductive to trapping more heat and we're currently seeing carbon levels rise at an unprecedented rate, up to ten times faster than the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which is considered a potential analog for our near future climate. Atmospheric methane volumes suggest that we've been analogous to an ice age termination event for almost 20 years already, and a hypothetical AMOC collapse actually risks a substantial collapse of oceanic carbon sinks and potentially risks carbon outgassing. If that wasn't bad enough, there's a distinct risk of methane hydrate destabilization specifically in relation to AMOC weakening. \n\nI've studied this particular subject for a few years now by conducting a cross-analysis approach and will hopefully publish my research next year (risk doxxing myself here). AMA if anyone wants to learn more about this angle."

His own words illustrate why it was going to be difficult.\n\n*As for why so many people still resist what the facts clearly show, I think, in part, the reason is that the truth about the climate crisis is an inconvenient one that means* ***we are going to have to change the way we live our lives.***\n\nWhat's happened since 2006?  Cars have gotten bigger, and we're buying more of the larger vehicles and driving them more miles.  Air travel has increased, from 2 billion passengers in 2006 to almost 5 billion now.  Cruise ships have increased, with the industry building bigger and bigger ships to keep up with demand, and they still can't build them fast enough.  Houses got bigger, requiring more energy to heat/cool them.  Our consumption of meat increased.  We shop more than we used to, buying more and more useless stuff -- things like fast fashion, which have been around since at least the 1990s, has exploded over the last 10-15 years.\n\nAnything you can think of that constituted our way of life in 2006 has been cranked up to 11.\n\nAnd then add in new stuff, like the explosive growth of the internet, which was tame in 2006 compared to now -- streaming, social media, gaming, AI.  \n\nA year after the book was published, the first iPhone was released, which kicked off an arms race of people constantly upgrading their smartphones, whether or not there was a need to do so.\n\nI could go on, but really -- why?\n\nA lot of people will point the finger at capitalism, that catch-all term that collectively describes the sellers, but everyone who can afford to do so is eagerly buying every single thing capitalism has to offer."

                "Content": "\u201cHours after former President Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 election, the Biden administration moved Wednesday to limit oil drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nOil drilling had been banned for decades in the Arctic refuge \u2014 a pristine natural region in northeast Alaska home to a wide range of threatened species. But a law passed during the first Trump administration required the federal government to hold two lease sales there for fossil fuel drilling. The first was in 2021 and was ultimately suspended and canceled by the Interior Department because of the lack of interest from the oil industry.\n\nThe Trump-era law required the second lease sale to be held before the end of 2024. The Biden administration signaled Wednesday it plans to move forward with a 400,000-acre auction \u2014 the lowest acreage it could legally offer.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the many ways the White House and administration are trying to protect some of Biden\u2019s biggest accomplishments while president, including his vast portfolio of action on climate change and the environment.\u201d"

She was saying that it was getting drier and drier and she can't grow apples any more. Now that whole region has burned away with the giant western wildfires. \n\nScientists were warning about the entire region going up in flames because warm air holds more moisture. Think of a giant sponge moving over the world. That's our atmosphere. It sucks up water from one area and drops it elsewhere. If it holds more moisture then that means that the dry regions will get  drier, and the wet ones will have massive dumps of water or snow. That was what was predicted 40 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago .... and we see it, exactly as predicted. \n\nIt was the cause of the Syrian refugee crisis as farmers could no longer grow. \n\nWe are on the verge of global food crises and climate migrants. \n\nThanks, unethical billionaires for funding partisanship leading to the collapse of science and politicians who make money denying climate change ... You've successfully destroyed everything ...  I hate it."

The only positive I can think of is those at the top have the farthest to fall and that typically means they will be the worst off at the end of it all. That was really well exemplified during the collapse of Rome. Those further from the center of Rome faired much better long term than those in the heart of Rome.

It will really depend on which breadbaskets and obviously how we all respond. I don't think it is necessarily going to be the cost of food that will bring down civilization, but the lack of it. If we don't have a multi-breadbasket failure for a good while, the cost of food might definitely take us down, but I think it will much more drastic than just an increase in costs."

I find it utterly infuriating when moderate Democrats think that they need to pay lip service to a toxic destructive climate monster of an industry to win Pennsylvania. I don\u2019t actually think that is true, because studies have shown that 70 percent of Pennsylvania residents want fracking either banned or much more tightly regulated.\n\nBut I don\u2019t need to be in love. I need to be able to vote strategically.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people showed up to protect this place and to hold moderate Democrats accountable, and that was the key to victory here.\n\n*You know who didn\u2019t show up for this place? Jill Stein. She doesn\u2019t show up for these frontline battles. Ever.*\n\n*Stein says she\u2019s against fracking, but Stein has hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the oil and gas industry. Did you know that? Did you know that she actually profits off of the oil and gas industry, that she has had investments in the Keystone XL pipeline and multiple fracking companies?*\n\n*Did you know that she has investments in Raytheon, that she\u2019s had investments in ExxonMobil? Did you know that she has investments in Home Depot\u2014one of the most rapacious companies in the world, guilty of horrific deforestation throughout the world?*\n\n*How is it that the Green Party candidate hasn\u2019t divested her own personal fortune from fossil fuels? It\u2019s sheer hypocrisy. And so is the strategy of running for president every four years but never showing up for battles like this.*\n\n*In 2016, Stein defended these investments by saying they are mutual funds and indexed retirement funds.*\n\n*But that, plainly speaking, is bunk.*\n\n*Her claims are a slap in the face to the entire fossil fuel divestment movement. It is easier now than ever to have investments that are fossil free; doing so is a huge plank of the environmental cause. Hundreds of real activists were arrested this summer in New York City calling for Citibank to divest as part of the Summer of Heat campaign. For Stein to ignore all this and still attempt to call herself an activist is beyond hypocrisy, it is political malpractice. Shame on you, Dr. Stein! Shame on you for profiting from fracking and oil drilling.*\n\nI\u2019m not in love with Kamala Harris\u2019s positions\u2014on fracking, and on some other issues. But I will tell you what I am in love with. I\u2019m in love with our movements.\n\nI\u2019m in love with what we can do. The entire history of progressive progress in this country is of movements pushing moderate presidents. It happened with FDR and the labor movement. It happened with LBJ and the MLK and the civil rights movement. It happened with Obama and Biden and the movement for gay marriage. We organize and push them\u2014and that\u2019s how we get what we want. That\u2019s our progressive history in America.\n\nBut in order for us progressives to do our jobs and fight effectively for a more just and equitable world as a movement, we need to have Harris in office. If we have Donald Trump in office, there\u2019s no chance in hell that we\u2019re actually going to advance an environmental agenda.\n\nSo I urge you to please believe in us as a movement. Love us. Believe in our power. We have done this before\u2014and we can do it again with a moderate Democrat in office. Which is the only choice we\u2019ve got right now.\n\nIf everyone in who voted for Stein in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan had voted for the Democrat instead, Trump would never have been the president.\n\nWe have the true power. It comes from the bottom up.\n\nAnd I believe in us.\n\nA vote for Harris is a vote for us, a vote for our movements to have a fighting chance for change. Progressive politics and advancing our agenda in this country is not something that happens every four years when you vote, or every four years when a toxic egomaniac like Stein (or Trump, for that matter) runs for president. It is a daily commitment. So vote for Kamala Harris. Join the movement\u2014and I\u2019ll see you on the front lines.\""

But first, a little history\u2026\n\nNot long ago the entire upper Delaware River basin in Pennsylvania\u2014one of the most beautiful areas in the country, in the watershed for New York City, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia\u2014was on the chopping block for fracking.\n\nA 75 mile stretch of the Delaware River could have become a toxic oil field. Fracking is an environmental apocalypse: millions of gallons of toxic fracking fluids, radioactive waste, underground water contamination, hundreds of thousands of truck trips, air pollution, land scarring, massive public health crises, and depleted water supply. Everything about the practice is toxic; it is inherently contaminating in the long and short term.\n\nOur community was quick to understand the threat and organize and mobilize against it. Every little town along the Delaware across New York and Pennsylvania had a mom-and-pop anti-fracking group spring up. My film Gasland, on HBO, was part of this campaign, and our Gasland tours went from town to town, Johnny Appleseed\u2013style, fostering our new movement.\n\nAmazingly, we won. We banned fracking in the Delaware River basin and in New York State, saving the water supply for 16 million people. One of the greatest achievements of the environmental movement in this century.\n\nWe did this by convincing the Democratic governors of New York and Delaware and the president at the time\u2014Barack Obama\u2014to ban fracking here. These were all moderate Democrats. Not exactly Bernie Sanders, if you know what I mean.\n\nRepublicans would have just said no. This whole place would have been completely fracked to hell. We would have lost. And the whole gorgeous, life-giving national treasure of the Delaware River would have been a toxic fracking zone.\n\nOur victory against fracking kept more carbon and methane in the ground than almost any other single environmental win in history\u2014making it a huge win for the climate as well.\""

They often repeat that \"no one's talking about collapse except doomers\".\n\nIt seems the conversation is changing, even within the scientific community itself. They spell out the overconsumption issue, something that is often overlooked in the climate change discussion. Everyone wants net zero and vast solar arrays to keep the consumption game going. This is an acknowledgment that we cannot \"consume\" our way out. With the Earth having a fixed amount of resources, the math is simple and devastatingly bad. Its either a lot less resources per person *or* same amount per person and a lot less people.\n\nThere is a reckoning coming. We will be forced to confront the cold hard reality of what capitalism and unfettered growth has given and taken from us. And what we will be required to give up or have taken away. The future, even with green technology and responsible resource management, will not involve billions of people living on this planet. And it will most certainly involve a lot more independence and self sufficiency than many today are willing to accept.\n\nTough times ahead, folks. This is just the beginning."

                "Content": "I think people need to let themselves be real and start to express themselves authentically. Like I stopped worrying about what people think once I realized I'm *actually* sandwiches in-between billions of years of time, and have begun posting text and video about my concerns on my Facebook. I feel free as a bird. But I think between the way people have done that regarding other issues, it's like we could instigate cultural change, and start allowing ourselves to be messy, complicated, diverse, emotional creatures, experiencing what we're experiencing, and in such obvious need and deserving of positive, effective leadership. \n\n\nFrom there we could work to dismantle the system as is and let it be known in so many ways all of the freaking *obvious* things that are wrong, that we won't stand for. And I think we have a special opportunity to do so by acting maturely and compassionately, but assertively, in the process and bringing about wide spread change, to be like, we're gonna deal with this -- TOGETHER -- and not let these bullshit differences slow us down. When they do we apologize, we forgive, we try again, we experiment, but we're not playing games with these disparities and the deception, greed and corruption. There's so many of us with so much good in our hearts and so much to offer, it's just so clear to me our potential. There's just too much common ground to stand on, and so much at our disposal. That's not even mentioning all of the incentives we have to try harder. \n\n\n\nI think being there for each other, living with integrity expecting open mindedness from others to do the same, discussing why those social expectations are in place ... Being a guide, informing, educating ... It could help us to unite in understanding our familial bond as a species, and shed that \"hippies aren't cool\" nonsense and reconnect with the planet and our goals, breaking down what gives us meaning and helps us lead fulfilling, productive lives, all around the world. This isn't just, whatever, like, something-optimism. I really see it, when people stop being so self conscious and judgemental. I think people crave positivity and a bright future, and a sense of community, even now. And I think the ticket to that is giving each other the flexibility to be real. If you're a big nerd, a rotten scoundrel, a sexist racist, whatever ... Let's deal with it. Let's find that common ground and understand each other and our similarities, what science reveals and what we need to do to get along and move forward."

What a bunch of lazy, entitled, selfish losers we've been. \n\n\n\nWell I'm done hiding. I rant all the time posting videos on my Facebook putting things into context for people now, bringing in big picture thinking and how we've normalized things and how without the work of those of the past we wouldn't have what we have now. About how extraordinary our existence is and how other life forms on the planet are our literal family. About how we're living in a vast billions of years old universe, and are sandwiched in-between billions of years worth of time ... So what do I care what people think of me and how they feel about how outspoken I'm becoming? Look at all the problems that exist. Do people think things are just gonna \"pan out\"? They think they lead unfulfilling lives now well just wait. All the movies and music and restaurants and concerts and get togethers in the world aren't gonna be able to take them out of their heads knowing that everything is falling apart and isn't right. And I will drive all of that home the rest of my days until I see the general populace doing WHAT'S RIGHT and treating each other and our planet with the respect it deserves. I better see friendliness too. I am done with this immaturity. If you can't HUG your fellow congressman GTFO. There needs to be more involvement of citizens too imho. There needs to be an inclusive international effort discussing how to navigate the future and with it understood that no matter your history and where you are and what resources are available to you we effing SHARE THEM. And, what do you know, lead fulfilling lives doing things of meaning in the process. Creating a healthy world, like??? It's all RIGHT THERE. How can we continue in our detrimental ways? What the hell. What the literal HELL. \n\n\nThat's how I feel about it."

They did this because climate stabilization means bringing fossil fuel use to approximately zero, and that would end their business.  That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.\n\nThere is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And not some sort of thing the government is doing.\n\nI.e., this may help democrats win elections, which is good for climate policy and action. Or at worst, not antithetical to climate policy and action, which is what republican politicians are as a party these days (not that there aren't individual exceptions).\n\n\nObviously like many in this sub, I actually appreciate high gas prices, as they have a terrible unpriced negative externality on the climate and people's health. Higher prices discourages purchase of less efficient vehicles and equipment, and discourages use of said equipment. Of course, I'd prefer raised prices a result of something like a carbon tax, rather than it going to the petroleum industry. Also, just politically I don't like the lack of personal responsibility in not pricing externalities of gas and vehicle use."

Just based on how much they decide to produce, or most often, not produce. They don't even need OPEC to move it.\n\nIn this way, Saudi Arabia really acts as a kind of back door Federal Reserve. Because they sell their oil almost exclusively in dollars, if their decisions shoot the price of oil to the moon because they restricted supply, a lot of the dollar money supply is going to be sucked out of circulation. And this is exactly what happened during the 1970s oil shocks, and leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, where oil topped out at $150 a barrel in the Summer of that year. They can pull a lot of money out of the system. Almost overnight.\n\nEdit: Grammar."

                "Content": ">Another fact that makes Helene\u2019s devastation so unprecedented is that almost none of those hundreds of billions of dollars in losses will be paid out by insurance. While the storm caused most of its damage through flooding, which is covered under a government-run flood insurance program, very few residents of the southern Appalachian mountains hold flood policies \u2014 even those who live in federally designated flood zones. As of now, these storm victims in North Carolina and Tennessee have no guarantee of comprehensive public or private assistance as they try to piece their lives back together. \n\nDomestic climate refugees.\n\nIf they weren't insured or were underinsured, insurance won't cover it. The small towns don't have the resources to rebuild. I doubt that states would pour a significant percentage of their GDP into rebuilding, nor would the federal government. And even if the latter two did, how many times could they do it?\n\nCan they stay in the ruins of their towns and eke out a marginal life? Will they move? Where to? Into what housing? What jobs will they find?\n\nDroughts, heat waves, storms, hurricanes, floods, rising sea levels... the \"FO\" phase of climate change is here, and we're not ready for it."

Mass strikes and boycott do and will continue to work, history has shown us this, but it requires a lot more work that simply a mass group of people refusing to work for a day. The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for over a year before it saw results, a mass general strike would need to last for more than a day and you need to build mutual aid networks to support those who are striking first or else the strike will fizzle out because people won\u2019t be able to get their basic needs met."

How important it was to all of our weather systems.\n\nIt's like the one climate issue in the news that's actually making sense to them.

And rather than abandon all of those efforts and focus on the Gulf stream the best we can do is just let it fail and adapt to it.

                "Content": "I really disagree with that; the reason we stopped living in balance is because of a mental shift that we as humans weren\u2019t part of nature, that nature was there for us to take advantage of and exploit it\u2019s resources.  The big recent push for this started around the time of Sir Francis Bacon and Descartes, the former of whom vivisected animals because they \u2018didn\u2019t really feel pain anyways and their screaming was just an instinctual reaction\u2019.  It laid the seed for this disconnect with the world around us, really as an attempt to justify acquisition.  There\u2019s a reason the First Nations people of North America thought that Europeans suffered from a mental illness and didn\u2019t grasp the concept fully of owning land, because those Westerners didn\u2019t have a respect for nature.\n\nThere are lots of detailed reports on this, this idea what we need to grow perpetually is a capitalist concept, in fact it\u2019s the core imperative of capitalism.  There are many books on the subject, I highly recommend Jason Hickel\u2019s work, Less is More and The Divide are both great deep dives into this.  It\u2019s great that there is a paper that *theorizes* something unprovable, but what I\u2019m suggesting is analytical and objective history."

But even then there were times we still managed to collapse the local environment, like Easter island. \n\nI know it's nice to think that all our ills come from a few who run our economic system, but the reality imo, is that we are just like every other single organism. Exploiting our environment until we are stopped by some natural limit. The problem is we overcame every low hanging natural limit, so it's going to take something like climate change or a deadly plague to limit us.\n\nThere was that paper recently that theorised the longevity of advanced civilizations, even ones that respect the environment and use renewable energy eventually overheat their planet through heat waste (it just takes a few thousand years rather than a couple of hundred)."

Even if every of the 10,000 rockets that hezbollah has shot was a 1 tonne bomb (i\u2019ll give you a hint, none were even near that magnitude), they would barely have dropped a tenth of the mass of bombs which Israel has dropped. \n\nTrying to both sides the environmental impact of the current crisis in the middle east is simply ridiculous. Especially once you consider the human toll of all this, 41,000+ people killed, 100,000+ injured, 20,000+ children killed, all 114 hospitals+health clinics in gaza destroyed\u2026 \n\nSure, iran, hezbollah, and hamas are no saints, but nothing they have done or will ever do will come close to the devastation israel has caused."

But as climate change increasingly fuels storms like Milton, he says, it\u2019s been harder to stay calm and collected. Climate change, in essence, has changed him. As*\u00a0[*he wrote in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/10/hurricane-helene-new-normal-future-destruction/)\u00a0*after Helene hit the Southeast last month, \u201cI look at storms differently. And I communicate differently.\u201d*\n\n*Below, in his own words, Morales reflect on how the climate crisis has changed his relationship with meteorology*.\u00a0*His story has been edited and condensed for clarity*:\n\n**I grew up in**\u00a0Puerto Rico. So, for years I had been tracking tropical storms and hurricanes. In 1979, there was a big hurricane that passed south of Puerto Rico, and then slammed into the Dominican Republic, a category five hurricane named David. And I think it was the clincher for me in terms of, Hey, this is a field of science that I want to pursue.\n\n\\[On Monday,\\] I was at the home office, just as we were about to go on air for the noon newscast, and an urgent bulletin came out from the National Hurricane Center indicating that Milton had become a Category 5 hurricane. I had a chart in front of me, and I looked at the barometric pressure they were reporting at noon, and I compared it to just what had been reported in the pre-dawn hours. And I go,\u00a0*Oh, my goodness*."

While also gaslighting humanity into thinking that we are all equally part of this and that we have to do our fair share. \n\nMost of humanity is innocent, shaped by the structures around them and powerless to reach the centres of power to steer us into another direction. The people of the Sahel, flood vicitms in Pakistan and residents of Indian cities falling victim to wet bulb weathers and dying because of it are all willful collateral damage taken into account by an economic system that wants to grow endlessy, seeks only profit and is kept alive by the oligarchy under which we all suffer."

                "Content": "It boils down to greenhouse gas emissions. Sunlight passes through them, it hits the ocean and land where it is absorbed, and then it is re-emitted as infrared light which cannot pass through the greenhouse gasses. This drives up the global temperature.\n\nThat higher temperature means three things: warmer oceans (more which contributes to evaporation), more water vapor in the atmosphere (warmer air can hold more water vapor, which also acts as a greenhouse gas and contributes to precipitation levels) and more energy in the atmosphere to drive storms. How much more energy? Well, 1 degree celsius warmer is equivalent to about 25x the amount of energy consumed by the entirety of the US in a year.\n\nThat's why greenhouse gas emissions lead to more frequent storms with more precipitation and stronger winds. This is where the eli5 answer ends. There are a bunch of more complex factors at play as well, such as the effects on ocean and atmospheric currents, and the role that living things play in stabilizing climate and contributing to habitability of ecosystems and the planet at large. The short version is that living things trap carbon and slow the glow of water, so when ecosystems decline, warming is accelerated through the release of greenhouse gases, flooding/landslides/mudslides become more common, and waterways can become permanently altered.\n\nIt's a lot of bad news."

This happened in just over 24 hours\u2014it\u2019s one of the fastest rates of strengthening ever observed on Earth. Meteorologists\u00a0[have even begun to speculate](https://x.com/webberweather/status/1843282756266287549)\u00a0that Milton could approach the theoretical maximum intensity for a hurricane in the Atlantic basin of 195 mph, challenging the record set by Hurricane Allen in 1980.\n\n  \nBut this hurricane isn\u2019t even happening in isolation. The one-two punch from Helene and Milton is what climatologists call a \u201ccompound event.\u201d With little to no time to prepare between landfalls, human misery becomes greater than the sum of the two storms separately. It\u2019s something that was highlighted as a symptom of climate change in\u00a0[the most recent National Climate Assessment](https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/focus-on-1/)\u00a0published by the Biden administration last year. As sea level rises and floods become more frequent, folks in Tampa\u00a0[are already fearing](https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2024/10/04/how-will-hurricane-helene-reshape-tampa-bays-housing-market/)\u00a0the effect of a further rise in housing costs that this year\u2019s storm season will likely bring.\n\n\n\nFor more from meteorologist Eric Holthaus: [https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/hurricane-milton-tampa-bay-disaster-category-five.html](https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/hurricane-milton-tampa-bay-disaster-category-five.html)\u00a0"

This is a statement of fact. \n\n> or support tariff on ev, \n\nThey do. This is a statement of fact.\n\n> or Biden administration has the highest us oil production, \n\nAnd record exports of gas. The U.S. is now the world's largest exporter of oil and gas.\n\n> etc to prove that they don't care about climate changes.\n\nIt proves that they don't care enough about it to actually have a positive impact on emissions overall, yes.\n\n> I think this is just not true. \n\nPresumably because you believe their rhetoric rather than their actions. And in fact, there really isn't any rhetoric anymore either. Harris has been all but silent on climate since she became the nominee.\n\n> The best way to encourage clean energy and clean vehicles is not to ban or restrict alternatives. \n\nYes, it demonstrably is.\n\n> The best way is to lower the cost of clean energy and clean vehicles, and to increase the number of stake holders of them and to reduce the amount of political opposition. \n\nIt certainly doesn't hurt to have lots of consumers already using the technology you want to support, but the whole problem is that there aren't all these people now. And adoption using market mechanisms alone is far far far too slow to meet the scientifically determined emissions reductions targets.\n\n> After all, we are a democracy. \n\nNo, the U.S. is an oligarchy with democratic features. The opinions of average people are irrelevant to government policy. \n\n> We need people to buy in them. \n\nYou can't say \"we are a democracy. We must buy them\". Under democracy, each person has one vote to decide on the future of the country.\n\nYou are describing a market where the rich have 1000s of times more \"voting\" power than everyone else. \n\nMarkets aren't democratic. They are plutocratic.\n\n> A good outcome is the demise of coal. It wasn't because anyone ban them. It was because coal had become too expensive.\n\nIt became expensive largely because of a ratcheting up of regulations on clean air and water, as well as CO2 emissions. Without government regulations driving up costs, coal would have remained competitive for much longer.\n\n> Biden-Harris administration has done a lot on lowering the cost of clean energy and clean vehicles. They deserve our support.\n\nThey have reduced costs on clean tech. That is true. But having cheap clean tech doesn't guarantee falling emissions for two reasons, which the administration knows.\n\n1. There is a growing demand for energy so you can add clean energy at pretty steep rates and still not significantly reduce dirty energy much.\n\n2. Leaving everything to the market in this case only works when you shovel money at energy companies continually. Why? Because clean energy is cheaper and much less profitable than the fossil fuel energy it competes with. That means that profit-maximising energy corporations and the banks that fund them will choose fossil fuel energy most of the time unless the government steps in to pad their profits. The real solution is for the public sector to massively scale out its generation of clean energy. Publicly owned utilities like the TVA should be set up everywhere and instead of subsidising corporations, state and local government should build the generation infrastructure itself. That would force private operators to compete with these public utilities, slashing prices and forcing the private sector to use clean energy because it's the only way they could generate energy cheaply enough.\n\nAnyway, Trump winning is undoubtedly terrible for climate. But Harris winning is pretty bad as well."

Then you agree there's a problem, but say it's not clear what's causing it and that it needs to be studied more before you hurt the economy. Then you say everybody already knows there's a problem and they've always known, so it's not our fault. Then you convince people it's society's fault and there's nothing anyone can do about it. And the whole time, you dump hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians you can own, reporters you can own, news outlets you can own, lobbyists, astroturfing and advertising claiming to the high heavens that you're the good guys."

It's linked to loss of cognitive function, kidney & cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure & fertility issues. A study found higher death rates in older adults living near Nascar leaded-patrol circuits precisely during races.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article thread\u00a0[https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld3zdoyqgd2g](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld3zdoyqgd2g)"

                "Content": "The article is based on [this study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq4330).\n\n\"One of the impacts of human-driven climate change is an increase in marine heatwaves, events in which ocean waters are much warmer than usual. We have seen that these events take a toll on marine species, from producers to predators, but it is unclear whether their impacts are persistent once water temperatures decline to normal levels. Renner\u00a0*et al*. report that more than half of Alaska\u2019s population of common murres died during a marine heatwave event between 2014 and 2016, with an estimated loss of 4 million birds. Recent population abundance estimates since then have found no evidence of recovery, suggesting that the heatwave may have led to an ecosystem shift\""

All pulling out of the Paris deal does is give them bad press, which they want to avoid.\n\nThe Paris agreement doesn't do anything on its own. Nobody is forced to do anything, it's more virtue signaling than anything else. Only the countries that care in the first place can make this deal matter."

Those include harvesting lithium from briny water and using natural gas to make hydrogen.\n> \n> Exxon is poised to spend around $3 billion this year on projects that provide alternatives to fossil fuels or reduce emissions, the Swiss bank UBS estimates. That amounts to about 11 percent of the company\u2019s planned capital outlay for the year, a smaller share than many large oil companies expect to spend, according to the bank.\n\nOne reason why Exxon is doing this but isn't saying it aloud is because of peak oil. That is, for decades, oil companies have been experiencing diminishing returns, or increasing amounts of energy needed to get decreasing amounts of oil, and of lower quality.\n\nThat means the world will have to shift to alternative forms of energy because it has no choice: to deal with increasing energy and resource demand per person worldwide due to a growing global middle class, it has to put all other energy sources online.\n\nOne catch is that alternative energy sources still require a lot of fossil fuels because their quantity and quality levels are also low."

However in the developed world especially Asia and China, 20 years is a big difference.\n\nIn 2000 China had a per capita nominal GDP of less than 2,000 or even lower, the same HDI as places in Sub-Saharan Africa. Today, it is at 13,000 and Coastal cities like Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, Qingdao, Suzhou etc. with combined populations of over 300 million live the same lives as South Koreans (nominal GDP per capita of 27 - 30k)\n\nJust 20 years ago, China was still a basket case. The USA has been the Global GDP and world leader since the 1950s and the sole unipolar power since the 90s, a whole 30 years of unchallenged leadership WASTED.\n\nTo put in perspective it's less about economic DOMINANCE but development. For the last 80 years the average American enjoyed washing machines, convenience stores, air conditioning. The average Chinese and developed world resident was experiencing FAMINE. Only in the last 30 years the Chinese have experienced the amenities the USA has had for the last 80 years.\n\nChina only started getting tough on the environment in 2014 due to air pollution,  hence the massive investments into EVs (BYD around this time Elon Musk laughed at them) then only in 2017 - 2018 actual stuff started taking place.\n\nSo in actuality China has a decade and within said decade it has made more strides than the rest of the world in 50 years since we knew climate change was a thing...\n\nAs a side note: China in 2020 did suddenly ramp up coal plants, but that was amid record power shortages due to the trade war and lack of Australian coal, and record temperatures requiring peak power to skyrocket. But if you look at the data, coal power use in each of the stations has declined. Eg. I built 10 more coal plants but the 1 plant instead of operating at 100% capacity, each operates at 10%. Coal is a stopgap measure against inconsistent renewable supply (which is why they are also pivoting to pump-storage and nuclear for consistent supply, and leading in battery storage like CATL etc.)"

                "Content": "So for energy generation (boiling water to make steam), salt water is not ideal.   Salt water especially when combined with temperature and pressure is very corrosive. Also you have to have a way of removing the salt and other contaminants left over and a place to dump them (even desalination plants struggle with this.  Dumping high salinity brine with pollutants can be bad for local ocean ecology).  It\u2019s a maintenance nightmare.   The Navy\u2019s nuclear aircraft carriers actually desalinate the water in separate plants on board before it comes near their engines for exactly this reason (the loss in efficiency is better than dealing with sea water corrosion and salt).\n\nAs for HVAC and industry, a lot of it comes down to efficiency and distribution.  Most HVAC systems aren\u2019t going to produce enough heat to make much fresh water and while industry makes a lot of heat it is very spread out over a region.   Running pipes and a distribution network every where is going to be a huge hassle to deal with.   Maybe if fresh water comes more valuable, steel mills and the like might but it will probably be easier to just setup direct renewable powered desalination plants for large scale water needs."

The truth is we waste a lot of fresh water because in the past it is a relatively cheap commodity.  If the price of water goes up, then we\u2019ll cut a lot of the waste.    Also if the price goes up then large scale desalination might become worth while.   Also renewables might lower the price of electricity to make it work economically.  There are newer ways of desalination under development as well that might work better than just heat based evaporation."

The Inflation Reduction Act is making US emissions decrease faster. Since we tend to be technological trendsetters, this will help other countries reduce their emissions faster too.\n\nNeedless to say, Trump has vowed to repeal the IRA if he becomes president, and would certainly do everything he could do undermine it if he failed at that. Harris, on the other hand, cast the deciding vote to pass the IRA. Showing up and voting for Harris is essential to keep the IRA in place and preserving our chance to meaningfully fight climate change."

And you see it in the comments even here in r/climate, where so many still say, \"The system needs to change, but I don't.\"  And climate scientists keep telling us the same thing -- system change requires individual change.\n\n*I often get questions that suggest people view this as a binary. \u201cDo you think individual actions matter when systemic change is what we need?\u201d But this is a false binary.

Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These narratives all vehemently dispute the reality of anthropogenic climate change, a vocal opposition that went decades without anyone countering it until the mid 2000s.  Centrists, liberals and progressives naively thought that the facts would win out given the marketplace of ideas.  This was one of the worst ideas ever in the history of ideas. We now know that lies and disinformation win out, and must be fought against at every level of society, particularly in the schools.  We are seeing the outcome of the paradox of tolerance, and even that idea continues to be challenged by the same shills."

And is a large source of rain for much of the United States and canada...\n\nEven if an extremely large data center used 11 million gallons of water a day, If it's coming from the Great lakes, it's not even a blip on what would have evaporated anyways.\n\nThe inflow to the Great lakes could be estimated at 1.5 trillion gallons a day.  With the natural evaporation of 1.3 trillion gallons that gives us a net plus of 200 billion we could consume without negatively affecting their levels.  But would need to do some calculations on how that would affect the outlet Rivers.\n\nYou could also make the argument that evaporating water artificially is good for the environment, especially if you transport that water to an area that doesn't get a lot of rain."

Biden smartly has kept domestic production high to keep prices down while also acknowledging climate change and passing legislation like the IRA that helps to drastically reduce the amount of said fossil fuel from actually being burned.\n\nIt sucks that there are a ton of idiots who don't care about climate change and who vote only based on gas prices, and it sucks that Republicans are a popular party in this country who voters support. Unfortunately those are the cards we are dealt.\n\nThe Democrats by and large were our only realistic way of achieving any climate legislation whatsoever, and basically all of them to my knowledge will acknowledge that it is a problem. They unfortunately need to pander to gas-head voters to actually get into power."

                "Content": "When people blame the Green Party for the 2000 election, they overlook the bigger picture and the complex series of events that actually influenced the outcome. Al Gore lost his home state of Tennessee, a critical piece of the puzzle, and if he\u2019d won there, he wouldn\u2019t have needed Florida at all. Then, let\u2019s talk about the Florida recount. The U.S. Supreme Court intervened in a deeply controversial decision, halting the recount and effectively handing the presidency to George W. Bush. This wasn\u2019t about Ralph Nader or the Green Party\u2014it was a decision made by the highest court in the country, a body that\u2019s supposed to remain neutral, yet their ruling had a decisive impact on who became president.\n\nIn Florida, there were layers of issues: outdated voting machines, \u201cbutterfly ballots\u201d that confused voters, and purges of voter rolls that disproportionately affected minorities, people who likely would have voted Democrat. And let\u2019s not forget the role of the media, calling the state prematurely and causing chaos on election night. All of these factors played a part in Bush\u2019s win, yet people keep pointing the finger at the Green Party as if it\u2019s that simple. Nader became a convenient scapegoat for a loss that was a product of mismanagement, structural failures, and political power plays.\n\nIn 2016, Jill Stein became the target of similar accusations, with some blaming her Green Party candidacy for Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton. But this narrative once again ignores the nuances and complexities of the election. Clinton lost key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by narrow margins, but attributing those losses to Stein\u2019s voters assumes those individuals would have voted for Clinton if Stein hadn\u2019t been in the race. Many third-party voters don\u2019t align neatly with the major parties and may have simply abstained or chosen another option if the Green Party wasn\u2019t available. Blaming Stein allows the Democratic Party and media to avoid facing issues that may have contributed more to the loss, like voter suppression efforts, campaign strategy missteps, or the lack of engagement with disaffected voters. The constant focus on blaming the Green Party prevents a deeper conversation about the underlying factors influencing voter disillusionment and shifts accountability away from the two major parties and the larger electoral system.\n\nBlaming third parties is easier than acknowledging these flaws in our political system. It lets the mainstream media push a narrative that\u2019s more digestible, that keeps people voting within the two-party system and stops them from questioning the system itself. And the same media that pushes this narrative about the Green Party also treats figures like Trump as \u201cnormal\u201d political players, despite his record of legal troubles and controversies. When people start seeing through these narratives and realize the role that both parties and the media play in shaping public opinion, that\u2019s when real change can happen. Until then, scapegoating the Green Party or any third party just distracts from the underlying issues and keeps us trapped in a cycle that doesn\u2019t benefit anyone.\n\nWake up and stop trusting msm, the establishment, and the military complex. You are a prime example of why we\u2019re in this messed. You fell for the propaganda hard!"

Even though they\u2019re pushing and lobbying for more oil and gas, they are also trying to scale up investment in renewable projects. They\u2019ve also had a productive few years under Biden, when, despite a push for renewable energy, America\u2019s oil production surged to unprecedented records. At a time when much of the world is pushing and lobbying for continued support for renewables, Exxon can\u2019t completely jump into the Trump ship while still maintaining a facade of sustainability.\n\nThe reason has likely to do not with climate change but with peak oil, as diminishing returns have been taking place: increasing amounts of energy needed to get decreasing amounts of oil. And the same thing is taking place for minerals, etc.\n\nAnd those are all needed for renewable energy because around 70 percent of mining, up to half of manufacturing, and the bulk of shipping require fossil fuels."

        "Content": "First, voters considering support for Jill Stein\u2019s presidential campaign must be aware that she is running almost openly as an asset to Russian President Vladimir Putin. And she is parroting Russian and MAGA talking points about the Democratic Party, while barely mentioning Donald Trump. That\u2019s why they know she\u2019s useful to them as a spoiler that can help Trump win: [https://www.thirdway.org/memo/red-alert-putin-puppet-jill-stein-and-her-russia-friendly-agenda](https://www.thirdway.org/memo/red-alert-putin-puppet-jill-stein-and-her-russia-friendly-agenda) That also why Europe\u2019s Green Parties have delivered a grave warning to Jill Stein to stand down\u00a0for the sake of America and the world: [https://newrepublic.com/post/187806/european-greens-warning-jill-stein-election](https://newrepublic.com/post/187806/european-greens-warning-jill-stein-election)\n\nSecond: The next president of the United States *will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris*, not anybody else and the election will be **close.** We don\u2019t have the luxury of voting third party or writing in the name of a fantasy candidate. (In most states, [those write-ins won\u2019t even count](https://www.usa.gov/write-in-candidates).). Consider the consequences for our country:\u00a0 most obviously, the project of a more progressive non-binary electoral system will be severely set back under a Trump administration, whose goal \u201con day one\u201d is to centralize power; to privatize or destroy the institutions that protect our democratic system.\u00a0\n\nThird: if you think it\u2019s fine to vote 3rd party because you may be in a blue state, consider how much the popular vote matters: If Trump loses big in the popular vote, as well as losing the electoral vote, it will be harder for him to challenge the election results (as he certainly will do). The larger the margin, the weaker his claim.\n\n\\[ Edit: Fourth: The interest in the suffering in Gaza is not a logical reason to hand the presidency to Netanyahu's closest, fascist ally, Donald Trump. In their letter asking Stein to step down from her candidacy, Europe's Green Party, wrote that \"electing Trump would embolden anti-democratic actions around the globe...**By taking away votes from Harris and allowing a Trump win, Stein will not be able to help 'bring about a just and sustainable peace in the Middle East,' an issue in which the U.S. Green Party candidate has staked her 2024 campaign upon.\" \\]** \u00a0\n\nThere is too much unbearable irony in the position that claims how, in the interest of Palestine, individuals should throw their vote away, and implicitly cast their support for Trump, who has made it clear that, if elected, he would put a \u201cswift end\u201d to the Ukrainian and Palestinian war conflicts; namely, by denying these territories of their autonomy'; by giving them to the warmongering dictators for whom he bends.\u00a0 That\u2019s why Netanyahu went down to\u00a0Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring.\u00a0\n\nBy consigning your vote into total irrelevance, you are implicitly supporting a candidate whose interests undermine your own in the most extreme way; who\u00a0calls climate change a \u201choax;\u201d whose policy includes mass deregulation; defunding or shuttering effective green energy technologies and industries that have the added benefit of improving our economy.\u00a0 In an Orwellian plan to make the citizenry forget climate change was a legitimate interest, the GOP even have plans to remove all references to words like \u201cclimate change\u201d in official documents (as DeSantis has already done in Florida).\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t make your voice irrelevant in a dogmatic fight for a representative whose actions self-consciously\u00a0 work in Trump's favor; against your own.",

If Jill Stein actually cared about anything other than seeming cool at the right kind of dinner party, she would have spent the last 20 years building a coalition and winning all over the place at the state level so there would be an actual meaningful party foothold. Instead, she shows up and redirects a dangerous percentage of people away from directionally correct outcomes into chasing la la land outcomes (because feeling righteous is more important than doing long-term good, apparently)...and we lose more ground to the right.\n\nPlease people, don't vote for Jill Stein. Use your vote for something meaningful, even if it's not 100% of what you want right away (American politics isn't your favorite fast food restaurant) -- steering us in the right direction changes the nature of the debate we'll be having in 5 and 10 and 20 and 30 years. Just ask the Federalist Society -- you know how the supreme court is a mess right now? The right wing plans for that started at the Federalist Society in the 1980s. Those right wingers worked on it for 4 decades to get the outcomes they wanted. We should take note. And this is one of those times when doing the right thing long-term is WAY WAY WAY more important than the sugar high of self righteousness you'll get from giving Jill Stein additional dinner party bragging rights."

Not simply by the increased loss of life in Gaza that Trump will empower, or the loss of life that climate change and mass extinction that Trump will enable, or even how the shift of global power to Xi and Putin and other dictators will cause catastrophic results and human suffering on a horrific scale, but also the sheer unpredictability that an unstable and dangerous Trump dictatorship might do.\n\nOf course, most of these anarchist / nihilists are white Americans born and brought up in the comfort, stability and luxury of the U.S. I am a brown immigrant who has lived under and seen the horrors of men like Trump. And who works in nonprofit in developing sectors of the world. So looking at this from my lens, there is only one obvious choice: Kamala Harris. She is an imperfect candidate, but vastly superior to any alternative and I believe she will be a net good even if I don\u2019t agree with everything she does. I don\u2019t have the luxury of having a candidate who agrees with everything I want, because that\u2019s not possible in a country of 350 million people. Only strongmen from failed states claim that everything is black and white. I don\u2019t want to live under a strongman."

And in a complete shock, the US accounts for the most passengers -- eyeballing it, we seem to be around 60% of the global total.  A lot of people here and elsewhere seem to believe this is perfectly acceptable, too, simply because the emissions per passenger are lower than private.  It's still an activity that only an estimated 20% of the world population has ever been able to afford to engage in, with only an estimated 10% of the world flying in any given year. Edit: Odd how that 10% corresponds to the \"World's richest 10% account for 50% of the emissions\" statistic that gets bandied about.\n\nAs for taxing billionaires?  Good luck with that.  You'd need 100% cooperation among all the nations of the world, otherwise billionaires would simply move their wealth to a country that's more friendly.  We're a bit famous for being unwilling to cooperate on a global scale.\n\nAnd really, would the UK tax the monarchy/aristocracy into oblivion?  Would Saudi Arabia tax the House of Saud into oblivion?"

That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.\n\nThere is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s not doing or saying all the things Hitler ended up doing in the 40s.  But he is on that path, and these things about Mexico, Canada, Greenland, isolationism, tariffs\u2026.

Though I am not sure of that.  \n\nTrump has promised an increase in drilling.  That will not be economical if the price of gas goes down.  It is ideal for Trump because he can blather about Zelensky and the war causing higher gas and grocery prices.  He can also \u201cpunish Ukraine\u201d by cutting off the delivery of ATTACMS missiles which are no longer produced and cannot be replaced by PrSM fast enough anyway.  \n\nGrouping oil drillers and the petroleum industry together frequently makes sense.

                "Content": "November Heat\n\nHelen sat at her kitchen table in western Massachusetts, deliberately not looking at the thermometer outside her window. Her daughter Sarah was at it again, pacing the linoleum floor like a doomsday prophet, iPhone clutched in her hand like it was broadcasting the word of God himself.\n\n\u201cMom, please,\u201d Sarah said, her voice tight with that anxiety Helen had always blamed on too much internet. \u201cThey\u2019re evacuating half of Vermont. The fires are\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Helen stirred her coffee with more force than necessary. \u201cThere have always been forest fires. And dry spells. When I was teaching, we had plenty of warm Novembers.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that \u2018warm\u2019 back then had meant fifty degrees, not today\u2019s sixty-eight. She didn\u2019t think about how she\u2019d had to pack away her sweaters this year, still unworn.\n\nSarah stopped pacing, her face flushed. \u201cRight. Just like there were always hurricanes, right? That\u2019s what you said last year when I begged you to install storm shutters. Before that category five took out half the coast. Just like there were always droughts, before the Colorado River died. Just like\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture from my own daughter.\u201d Helen\u2019s voice had that sharp edge she\u2019d used on stubborn students for forty years. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through every doomsday prediction they could dream up. Y2K. Nuclear winter. Acid rain. The ozone hole. And here we still are.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus Christ, Mom.\u201d Sarah slumped against the counter, suddenly looking older than her thirty-five years. \u201cYou know what your problem is? You think this is an argument you need to win. Like it\u2019s parent-teacher night and you\u2019re defending your curriculum. But nature doesn\u2019t care if you believe in it or not. It\u2019s not a democracy.\u201d\n\nHelen opened her mouth to respond, but her words were cut off by the emergency alert sound from both their phones. Sarah grabbed hers first, her face draining of color as she read.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re evacuating Hampshire County,\u201d she said, her voice hollow. \u201cThe Berkshire fires jumped the firebreak. They\u2019re saying the wind\u2014\u201c She stopped, looking up at her mother. \u201cMom, we have to go. Now.\u201d\n\nHelen wanted to argue. Wanted to tell her daughter she was being dramatic again. But through the kitchen window, she could see the sky had taken on that strange copper color she\u2019d only ever seen in news footage from California. The wind that rattled her windows carried the smell of woodsmoke, and not the cozy kind from her neighbor\u2019s fireplace.\n\nHer phone buzzed again. Then again. Emergency alerts stacked up like playing cards: Mandatory evacuation. Road closures. Air quality warnings. The maple tree she and George had planted thirty-five years ago cast flickering shadows on her kitchen floor. Its leaves, confused by the endless warm autumn, had never fully turned. Now they might never get the chance.\n\n\u201cI never thought...\u201d Helen\u2019s voice trailed off as ash began to drift past her window like gray snow, settling on her November roses that hadn\u2019t known to die back this year. In the distance, she could hear sirens.\n\nSarah was already pulling her go-bag from the closet\u2014the one Helen had mocked her for leaving here. \u201cNever thought what, Mom?\u201d\n\nHelen stood up slowly, her coffee forgotten. \u201cNever thought it would happen here,\u201d she said softly. \u201cTo us.\u201d\n\nThe wind picked up outside, hot and hungry, and Helen finally understood what Sarah had been trying to tell her all along: nature didn\u2019t care what you believed. It just was. And now it was coming for them all, believers and deniers alike.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sarah said, taking her mother\u2019s arm. \u201cWe need to go. Now.\u201d\n\nAs Helen let herself be led to the door, she thought about all those school board meetings where she\u2019d argued against updating the science curriculum to include climate change. All those Thanksgiving dinners where she\u2019d dismissed Sarah\u2019s concerns as millennial anxiety. All those years of certainty, crumbling like ash in the November heat.\n\nThe emergency sirens wailed across the valley, singing a song of too little, too late.\n\n(by Claude)"

Almost all of big media were bought by the capitalists to boost their lies .  And now here we are with the biggest con shitbag that ever lived, as the president of what still is the most powerfull nation on earth , who doesnt care about anything as long as he cant line his pockets from it, and line his pockets is what most of the capitalist motherfuckers will do, to keep their dirty polluting bussines going . If this doesnt sadden you or leave you with that feeling of total doom , you might be very stupid or you have a very thick skin . I hope its the latter"

                "Content": "Sorry you're getting downvoted, but you are right. People aren't willing to endure the kind of disruption these major changes will have.\n\nFor example, banning gas-powered vehicles will force everyone to buy more expensive cars at a time when car prices are already sky-high. We don't have the infrastructure to support that. A power outage that lasts any length of time will strand people because they won't be able to recharge their cars. Nobody wants to deal with that kind of added expense and inconvenience.\n\nA lot of the emissions problems could be helped if companies would just allow everyone to work remotely who isn't absolutely needed on the premises, but you can see corporations are now demanding everyone return to the office after COVID. Corporations are not going to cooperate with any effort to make more jobs remote.\n\nIn addition, the costs of shipping companies switching over to EVs will drive up the cost of everything we buy. Everything has to be transported. Replacing all the gas-powered vehicles with EV will cost a fortune, and companies will need to install a massive number of charging stations to charge all the cars and trucks in the fleet.\n\nEach one of us only has one life to live. Who wants to endure the disruption of changing over for the duration of their natural life? People are not that concerned about future generations beyond their own children and grandchildren.\n\nIt will take a lot more natural disasters to break down people's resistance to change. They may have to lose everything in a major storm before accepting the current system can't go on.\n\nI'm personally sitting through more tornado warnings every year and just hoping I can reach the end of my life without having my home destroyed. I have definitely noticed more severe weather happening in my area. It's really intolerable living with the uncertainty, but unless we can get everyone on board with making a lot of sacrifices, nothing is going to change."

I'd probably have to live way outside the city and spend 1hr+ commuting each way for a job, and have basically no disposable income for anything beyond cheap groceries. Would that make me \"rich\"?\n\nThe real \"rich\" of the world are the multi-millionaires and billionaires that own the means of production, have outsized influence in government policy and in market dynamics, and who consume ridiculous amounts of resources compared to even the next highest 10% of the population. But how much actual money that requires would certainly be different in different regions of the world. I just saw a graph the other day comparing the top 1% in Europe to the next 10%, 40%, and the bottom 50% of Europe, and even in one of the most developed parts of the world the difference between that 1% and the next 10% is enormous."

All of a kind not seen before. Older rings rings reflected climate stability. The younger rings showed extreme climate instability combined with ever warmer temperatures. \n\nChanges that happened slowly over centuries when the climate transitioned from colder to warmer periods in the deep past were suddenly occurring rapidly in only a few years. \n\nThat\u2019s when I decided to become a climate professional.

That and it was largely ignored by the media outside of the country so the vast majority of people outside Mexico other than scientists or weather enthusiasts had no idea it happened. This is your potential future across the US, people won't believe climate change is real unless it affects them directly, and by withholding access to as much information as possible they plan to get at least 4 years of uninterrupted expansion."

He's since said he sides 100% with Israel, and want them to \"finish the job\" when it comes to Palestine.\n\nIf you at all supported any muslim, or palestine at all, Harris was the absolute, best, most important vote.

Remember, this is what they're telling *policymakers*\n\n*Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5\u00b0C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}*\n\n*Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0\u00b0C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8\u00b0C to 1.2\u00b0C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5\u00b0C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.1) {1.2}*\n\nWe've also seen that this little tidbit has been shown incorrect as well. Remember the sea sponge study being maligned then shown to be potentially correct? \n\n*Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for the decade 2006\u20132015 was 0.87\u00b0C (likely between 0.75\u00b0C and 0.99\u00b0C) higher than the average over the 1850\u20131900 period (very high confidence).*\n\nI get that the IPCC is a trusted source and all that, but the fact remains they are seriously under representing the outcomes and possibilities.\n\n[This](https://youtu.be/k0FUZKQhU6U?si=Lz8D49p0j5Cv0dfz) talk from Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor of Physics of the Oceans, Potsdam University has a nice little side by side of current vs IPCC predictions of ocean currents around the possibility of AMOC collapse.\n\nI'm tired of people defending a body that is leading us to our destruction because of \"politeness\" and \"consensus\""

I say rigged because billionaires just use a lot of money and influence to make huge campaigns for their candidate of choice. Propaganda just really works.\n\n\nIt's just enough freedom to keep people from revolting.

Got us health insurance, even/especially the people with \u201cpreexisting\u201d conditions who both need insurance the most and who were often priced out of the market for private plans. Created the longest period of uninterrupted stock market growth, longest period of jobs growth. To argue against that is plain deluded.\n\nYea, we all agree Biden sucked. He was a stop gap who should have been in for a single term. His purpose for existence in the 2020 election was that he was more electable than trump. With that not the case in 2024\u2026 oh well spilt milk. \n\nStill, the right blamed him for things well outside his control. Inflation? Inflation wasn\u2019t a US problem, it was world wide. And we got it to a far lesser extreme than most other countries. Even the incoming president has changed his tune (already), rather than making America affordable again, he\u2019s already saying how difficult it is to bring prices down and he hasn\u2019t even tried. \n\nThe Trump presidency was a disaster and a farce in so many fronts. It\u2019s only a testament to poor education in so many states coupled with relentless propaganda that you and so many others view those 4 years as anything but. \n\nGood bye"

In 2024, the Biden administration put tariffs of  **50%** on solar panel components imported from China.\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm\n\nSome background here is worth it.\n\nChina\u2019s government screwed up, big time.  They\u2019ve VASTLY over invested in all sorts of manufacturing through what we would call crony capitalism.  Extreme subsidization of manufacturing is normal in China, and it always goes to party loyalists.  It is an unfair trade practice.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: what this means is that China effectively sells all sorts of things to the rest of the world (exports) at a NET FINANCIAL LOSS TO CHINA.\n\nWhen you add up all the subsidies into the expenses and investment they put into things like Solar Panel manufacturing\u2026 they\u2019re losing money selling things.  Especially when they\u2019ve overproduced things like solar panels SO FAR that the prices are *spiraling downwards*.\n\nThere\u2019s a good case for tariffs against China.\n\nBut for solar panels?  Dude: I want a bargain on solar panels that I can strap on my roof to basically negate the cost of AC in the summer.  It would DRASTICALLY reduce the cost of my personal electricity bill in the summer.\n\nIt\u2019s not like solar panels are some huge industry in the US.  The ENTIRE solar panel manufacturing industry in the US is a pitifully small 31,000 workers.  For reference, there are 12,000,000+ workers in manufacturing all together in the US."

The had a majority in the house to accompany that for just 4 years (2 separate terms, spread out by over a decade). \n\nThey did have the senate for most of that time, though. Having Manchin and Sinema didn\u2019t help matters. \n\nAnd what was on their agenda during the brief moments of unified control? Recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, Obamacare, and recovering from COVID lockdowns. \n\nThose were all things that could be accomplished in the time window they were given. Addressing climate change needs more focus than that, and certainly requires being either lasting majorities or for republicans to pay heed when they come to power, rather than immediately rollback any change they can find and do all they can to exacerbate the issue. \n\nYou can say democrats failed. I can say we (the American people) failed by expecting change in an instant and, not seeing what they wanted, failing to show up. It\u2019s costing us dearly and it\u2019s costing the world dearly. \n\nNationally, we\u2019ve  given away the Supreme Court for generations, and globally not only are we failing to cut our own emissions, we\u2019re failing to play a roll in the conversation and global action at all. Who\u2019s going to sign a 6 year agreement, let alone a 50 year agreement, knowing that it may get torn to shreds 2 to 4 years later?"

These are completely feasible actions that will still allow most people to live well.\n\nIf we continue to ignore it even longer and don't take any action, we're going to eventually have eco fascism where food is entirely rationed, blackouts will be scheduled, freedom of movement will disappear, etc.\n\nIf we ignore it even longer than that, then billions of us will die. In addition to extreme weather events and most coastal cities going underwater, the global food chain will collapse and we will have mass starvation."

This network would operate in addition to large scale industrial storage solutions, such as utility run battery farms and perhaps thermal storage solutions.\n\nGrids fail when demand is too high, but they can also fail when demand is too low.

                "Content": "In case anyone is curious as to how they become more expensive:\n\nIf a blanket tariff were imposed on all imports, the price of eggs in the U.S. would likely increase rather than decrease, despite eggs being primarily a domestically-produced product. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Higher Costs for Feed and Farming Supplies\n\n\t\u2022\tMany components used in egg farming, such as feed, equipment, and supplies, are either imported or rely on global supply chains. A blanket tariff would increase the cost of these imported goods, driving up operating expenses for egg producers. This could lead to higher prices for eggs as producers pass these costs onto consumers.\n\n2. Increased Fuel and Transportation Costs\n\n\t\u2022\tTariffs could increase the cost of fuel if imported oil or refined fuel becomes more expensive. Higher fuel prices would raise transportation costs, affecting every step of the supply chain, from farm to grocery store. These increased transportation costs would likely contribute to a rise in egg prices.\n\n3. Inflationary Pressures on Food Prices\n\n\t\u2022\tIf a blanket tariff led to higher prices across various goods, it could fuel broader inflation in the economy. As consumer goods become more expensive, general cost-of-living increases could create upward pressure on food prices, including eggs.\n\n4. Indirect Impact from Retaliatory Tariffs\n\n\t\u2022\tIf other countries retaliate by imposing tariffs on U.S. exports, American agricultural products could face reduced demand abroad. This could hurt sectors like soybeans (used in animal feed) and drive up feed costs domestically, increasing egg production costs.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile eggs are primarily a domestic product, a blanket tariff would increase operational and supply chain costs for egg producers, leading to a likely increase in egg prices for U.S. consumers. The interconnected nature of global trade means even domestic goods can be impacted by tariffs on imports."

Tax cuts and even less regulation. \n\n\n\n\"Some of the major setbacks we can expect include massive cuts to climate-focused agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Interior, with climate-hostile directors at the helm; expanding oil and gas production and limiting clean energy development; rescinding billions in unspent funds from the Inflation Reduction Act and reallocating them toward high-carbon activities; and dismantling environmental justice initiatives. Federal climate policies will be put on ice, making it unlikely that the U.S. will meet its emissions-reduction targets. Internationally, the U.S. is expected to pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and reduce climate finance assistance to vulnerable nations.\"\n\n[https://www.wri.org/insights/trump-climate-action-setbacks-opportunities-us](https://www.wri.org/insights/trump-climate-action-setbacks-opportunities-us)"

Sometimes there are government plans available for coverage (also often costs a lot more). These $ amounts might be unsustainable for most, driving them out of the home in the long term. \n\nBeyond that it isn't so clear. Your mortgage requires insurance, does this mean the banks can foreclose?  Going into the 2008 crisis, one of the issues was that banks don't want to own houses, owning hundreds or thousands of them in markets which can't sell any houses at all was not appealing.  In a situation like that banks will be inclined to be lenient, it is in their interest.\n\nThese days there's a lot of banks (and other financial operations) that WANT to own homes. They might be likely to grab property at low prices if they can arrange a bulk insurance deal and pass on the costs to renters. Largely that would hinge on whether people still wanted to live there (are there even jobs)? Is the land valuable for something besides houses (something more climate resistant)?"

I took pictures of them in the act, of their vehicle and very clear license plates, and of their faces. The police never pursued it and told my neighbors that there was nothing they could do except provide a police report for their insurance to cover the replacement of their gas tank.

The \"all is doomed give up now\" talk helps no one: \n\n  \n*The new study, published Thursday (Dec. 5) in the journal*\u00a0[*Science*](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4461)*, analyzed over 30 years of biodiversity and climate change research, encompassing over 450 studies of most known species. If greenhouse gas emissions are managed in accordance with the*\u00a0[*Paris Agreement*](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/)*, nearly 1 in 50 species worldwide \u2014 an estimated 180,000 species \u2014 will be at risk of extinction by 2100. When the climate model's temperature is increased to a 4.9 F (2.7 C) rise, which is predicted under current international emissions commitments, 1 in 20 species around the world would be at risk of extinction.*\n\n*Hypothetical warming beyond this point makes the number of species at risk rise sharply: 14.9% of species were at risk of extinction under a 7.7 F (4.3 C) warming scenario, which assumes high greenhouse gas emissions. And 29.7% of all species would be at risk of extinction under a 9.7 F (5.4 C) warming scenario, a high estimate, but*\u00a0[*one that is possible*](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/)\u00a0*given current emissions trends.*"

After 7 years of monitoring populations across 13 Alaskan nesting colonies, US Fish & Wildlife realized they hadn\u2019t fully grasped the scale of what was happening.\n\nResearch found more than half of Alaska common murres died, 4 million, in the largest mortality event of any non-fish vertebrate wildlife species reported during the modern era. Killings were an order of magnitude larger than hundreds of thousands perishing in the 1989 Exxon Valdez Alaskan oil spill.\n\nSome populations of such forage fish collapsed during the heat wave as north Pacific temps spiked 2.5 to 3\u00b0C above normal. Many predators that rely on them suffered. The number of Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska crashed 80% between 2013-2017, leading to temporary Alaska commercial fishery closures\n\nThe study compared a seven-year period (2008-2014) before the marine heat wave and another seven-year stretch afterward (2016-2022) and found that murre numbers fell 52% to 78% at 13 colonies across two large marine ecosystems in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nAbridged (shortened) article [https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld7bv65znk2x](https://bsky.app/profile/johnhatchard.bsky.social/post/3ld7bv65znk2x)"

He knew they would protect him from \"being cancelled\" (code for when a thin skinned white dude faces criticism for the first time in his life).  \n\nHis climate crusade was never sincere in the first place.  After all, were high end sporty electric vehicles that make EV's sexy and cool to western consumers what we actually needed circa 2012 to stave off climate change?  Anyone who knows anything about transportation would have told you that investing in public transportation would have had a far greater impact.  Elon's crusade was all about his desire to get attention for being the only genius who could save the planet.  He wants people to think he's Tony Stark when in reality he's just JP from Grandma's boy. Elon is a fraud and always has been."

I remember the early discussions when Tesla was just gaining popularity and many opinions were maybe it was worth it to get EVs mainstream. Once EVs were accepted by the carheads thanks to their performance mass adoption would follow. Musk also was promising a cheap mass market EV - which of course never came.\n\nSo now we\u2019re stuck with expensive \u201cluxury\u201d EVs from every brand as they all have rushed to copy the Tesla model. And what cheap EVs we could have gotten from overseas have been blocked by high tariffs. Sigh."

                "Content": "Earlier this year, top executives at Tesla gathered in Palo Alto to sell CEO Elon Musk on a line of compact cars that would bring the electric-vehicle revolution to budget-conscious consumers across the world. The more affordable car had long been part of Musk\u2019s master plan for Tesla to fight climate change by \u201caccelerat\\[ing\\] the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d\n\nBut Musk axed the proposal, amid budget constraints, according to two people close to Musk who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Instead, the billionaire green-lit a massive purchase of computer chips, in a deal\u00a0[worth billions](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1784561310883344542?s=46&t=gCyQFm4KvXRKGBnU3utTtA)\u00a0intended to enhance Tesla\u2019s luxury cars (and a humanoid robot called Optimus) with\u00a0[energy-intensive artificial intelligence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/11/19/ai-cop29-climate-data-centers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)\u00a0capabilities.\n\nThe internal deliberations over the so-called Tesla Model 2, which have not previously been reported, reflect a significant shift in the billionaire\u2019s attitude toward climate change. And with Musk deeply embedded in the incoming administration of President-elect\u00a0[Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), his startling transformation from environmental crusader to critic of dire climate predictions could help bolster moves in Washington against\u00a0[clean energy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/15/why-trump-hates-wind-turbines/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5)\u00a0\u2014 and even electric vehicles.\n\nRead more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/10/elon-musk-climate-change-worldview-trump/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/10/elon-musk-climate-change-worldview-trump/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)"

                "Content": "The original founders had a different vision. \n\nElon and them both agreed on buying the roadster model and putting their tech in. Both agreed this would show the world electric cars could be functional, fast, and cool. (Public perception at the time saw electric cars as slow, maybe not waterproof/weatherproof, low range, wimpy. Think original Prius perception.) \n\nOg founders from there wanted to use that as a concept car to sell Tesla's drivetrain tech to other companies. So like a honda van would use tesla drivetrain, and tesla wouldn't independently make cars.\n\nElon decided he wanted to make cars from scratch and be an actual car company. \n\nBoth realities would have ended up in very different results. But I think it's not unsafe to say that original tesla likely would have failed without Elon's cash infusion and crazy backing. Every other electric car company failed. Often getting bought out or some kind of moat from traditional car companies. So it is a fair analysis to make that Elon Musk's actions brought electric cars into mainstream 10-15 years sooner than they otherwise would have. They made the first mass produced electric cars. Even as they were doing it, others said it was impossible. \n\nI'm not a fanboy and we can accurately criticize him for everything he's done since. But it's silly how people on the internet decide they want to rewrite history just because they don't like someone."

Their main advantages are being cheaper and they don't have the thermal runaway issues of Lithium Ion.   They will most likely be used for cheap low ranged cars/scooters and non-automotive uses.   There are, however, some promising breakthroughs in Lithium Sulphur which if they pan out will provide significantly increased energy density."

                "Content": "Wool is [terrible for the environment](https://www.collectivefashionjustice.org/shear-destruction), [2](https://www.collectivefashionjustice.org/shear-destruction). \n\n\n\nThe paper you're likely thinking of about wastewater is this one: \n\n[A review on microplastic emission from textile materials and its reduction techniques - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878) which is a good review. The focus is more on synthetic and cellulosic fibers. Wool is not that popular, much to the dismay of sheep herders. \n\nI recommend reading the article. Here's a snippet:\n\n> The fiber fragments in the marine environment are classified as either natural or synthetic. The concentration of [cellulosic fiber](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cellulosic-fibres \"Learn more about cellulosic fiber from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") fragments in the ocean is much higher than the synthetic fiber fragments [\\[63\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0063). Nevertheless, [natural fibers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/natural-fibre \"Learn more about natural fibers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") like cotton, wool, silk and man-made [cellulosic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cellulosics \"Learn more about cellulosic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") fiber like bamboo, modal, tencel/lyocell are biodegraded as compared to the [thermoplastic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/thermoplastics \"Learn more about thermoplastic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") fibers in the marine environment [\\[64\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0064). Currently, the natural and man-made cellulosic fibers are floating on the oceans since they were disposed during the previous decade [\\[63\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0063). Generally, natural, and man-made cellulosic fibers are degrading easily, however, the presence of dyes and textile finishing chemicals can reduce their rate of biodegradation [\\[64\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0064), [\\[65\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0065), [\\[66\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0066), [\\[67\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0067). Due to the high production/consumption rate of [PET fibers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/polyester-fiber \"Learn more about PET fibers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (over 70% of the global fiber production) [\\[62\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0062), PET fiber fragments are commonly found in environment [\\[68\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0068) and the contamination in the ocean in the order of, PET [\\[69\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0069) \\&gt; PAN [\\[69\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0069) \\&gt; PP [\\[70\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0070)\\&gt; PA [\\[70\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391022000878#bib0070).\n\n\nSeparately, one that says more about wool:\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2021.662168/full\n\nWool, for example, is very heavy.\n\n>In contrast, heavy MF\u2019s (Experiments 3 and 4) will mostly be found in the water layers close to the seafloor, nearby the discharge point, not immediately leaving the fjord. Neutral MF (Experiment 2) is present both in surface and bottom layers, which indicates distribution within the whole water column.\n\nso it settles at the bottom (it's not good either, the ecosystems at the bottom are important too).\n\nBoth papers refer to *microfibers* in the sense of *micro fibers*, not exclusively focusing on fossil plastic (yes, [bioplastics](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/04/bioplastics-as-toxic-as-regular-plastics-both-need-regulation-say-researchers/) are also a problem)."

They would be impossible to pay USD, since Russia/Iran can't use USD. They are already sanctioned. If the payment is not in USD, what can US do?\n\nIf you trust the media, US is an net exporter of oil. Thus the major oil buyers, such as China and India, will have to abandon USD when they buy oil. Which in turn decreases US ability to sanction"

                "Content": "The earth had very long warm periods in its past. So it\u2019s doubtful the collapse itself will cause another ice age. What seems to drive the long term Climate on earth  is the amount of greenhouse house gas in the air. It does change on its own. For example when land plants first evolved, they quickly began to grow to really large sizes. But, the microbes that now rot our boats, houses and fences hadn\u2019t evolved yet. So the wood back then didn\u2019t rot away when the tree died, and release its carbon back into the air. It took that carbon into the ground and eventually it became coal. All that carbon was being leeched from the atmosphere by millions of years of trees. Volcanism replaced some of it. But eventually the climate began to cool. At some point microbes that could break down plant matter evolved, so that carbon sink stopped working. There will never be any huge deposits of coal formed again. (Maybe a peatbog here and there) \nHumans are releasing all that ancient stored carbon by burning the coal. On top of that, our suns energy output has risen by 5-10 percent since those primordial trees were alive, and is expected to continue this trend in the future. It\u2019s very possible, likely even, that today\u2019s earth is the coolest it will ever be."

The U.S. is no saint there either, but Russia and China still just made the U.S. a far more dangerous country, so that's a mark against China (Russia not being a contender)."

That does NOT mean a 73% decrease in the total wildlife population in 50 years. \n\nSo it could just as easily be worse, is what you're saying.  Correct?\n\nThe article you posted is good though, I did read it through and understand that the average is a subset of smaller population samples, rather than raw loss in numbers.\n\nBut to a certain extent, we don't know with clarity.  There's a part in the WWF report, for instance, that talks about the Amazon *possibly* becoming a net carbon increase, rather than a carbon sink as it was historically...\n\nExcept, that's already happened, and has been reported on by major outlets.\n\nI dunno...sounds a bit like coping behavior.\n\nIt's like a recent article I read that was still using language about IF we hit +1.5 C over pre-industrial times, and I'm like...we're already there.  We've been there for well over a year now.\n\n\nI guess, at the end of the day...are you trying to save others from apathy and despair...or are you really just trying to shore your own walls up?  Against a lifetime where humans *don't* suddenly turn a corner and wake up all at once, vaulting into delirious extreme action to save wildlife and the planet at large?\n\nAre people *allowed* to despair, if you gave them the honest, open truth?...not sugarcoated in any way whatsoever?\n\nI know these are difficult questions, but they're questions that everyone who gives a damn needs to be asking.  Both in ourselves and from each other, about what it is that we actually expect to happen, from humanity at large."

I\u2019d give civilization another 50-70 years?Probably half of earth\u2019s species will go extinct and civilization has a good chance of collapsing. Our species will outlive the collapse, but immediate resources will be so scarce that I imagine most of the human race will die out within a short span of time. Water scarcity and food shortages caused by heat and drought will create tensions, wars, and riots. We\u2019ll forget our humanity even more as we clamor for what remains. Supply chains would collapse as countries fight, and critical infrastructure would follow too. We\u2019re all dependent on each other\u2014just look at where most of the world\u2019s grain comes from, or where most rare earth metals are mined. It\u2019s like each country provides something the rest of the world needs. As some countries fall, other countries that depended on them for essential trade will suffer more and more, becoming unstable until collapsing themselves due to rioting, angry entitled citizens. Countrys\u2019 stabilities will collapse like dominoes. Earth won\u2019t be as beautiful as it was in the last few thousand years until a few million years from now. My wife and I chose not to have kids for this very reason. Not because we were sparing them from a horrible future, but because earth doesn\u2019t need more people and we want to give it chance to heal. We made this sacrifice along with many others. At the end of the day, too many of us weren\u2019t willing to go without and change our lifestyles. I don\u2019t mind us nearly wiping ourselves out at this point, it\u2019s just unfortunate we\u2019re taking so much other unique life with us."

Today. \n\nBecause they're still talking about long-term averages (20 years), which to me (as a layman) is a misguided position to take as long as each year is warmer than the previous.  But still, it's their position.  So yeah, we're almost certain to finish 2024 with the year at 1.6, but the long-term average will still be well under 1.5, which is why they say keeping it under 1.5 is achievable.\n\nThat's why a story like this is even worse than it sounds.  2.0 by 2040 means that the long-term average (2020-2040) will be that high, which comes with the certainty that the shorter term averages will be far higher.  For the long term average to reach 2.0 by 2040, 2035-2040 are going to be blisteringly hot."

Emissions were on a fairly constant upward trajectory, but temperatures weren't reflecting that yet because there's a delay between GHG emissions and the peak warming associated with them.\\*  So emissions could go up, but a year could still be cooler than the one that preceded it.\n\nIf 2025 is significantly cooler than 2024 (unlikely to me, but hey, my opinion is just that, an opinion), then thinking long term could still be useful.  But if 2025 is hotter again, maybe 1.65-1.70, then long term should be abandoned.  It won't, but it should.\n\n\\*That delay averages 10 years, so the GHG that were emitted in 2014 reached peak warming in 2024.  Which is an additional level of terror, considering that we have 10 years of emissions that haven't reached peak yet, including 2024's record emissions."

At most it says that the richest 10% generate 50% of the worlds emissions and the richest 1% generate 16% of emissions. Okay, fine.\n\nThe thing is that there are a little over 3000 billionaires in the world, which is .000038% of the worlds population, and does nothing to show that this minuscule cohort's \"personal choices can affect climate change\". On the subject of billionaires specifically all it does is throw around anecdotes involving big numbers from yachts and private jets absent any context, but what I find interesting is that it zero's in on the Walton's personal emissions but has nothing to say about *Walmart's* emissions, which measures its carbon output in megatons and gigatons.\n\nI don't like excessive consumption but I think it's more socially corrosive than it is meaningfully impactful on the environment. Just the fact that the mega-rich exist means that tax systems needs to be overhauled to be much more progressive - when you look at how tax bands have diminished over the years you can see how social stratification became so much more entrenched over the past 70-odd years. Everyone treats the rich like they're different, like they should be \"doing more\" to help the environment, world hunger, etc etc - and that gives them far too much power, almost rendering them laws unto themselves. Better by far they be taxed out of existence - certainly the concept of a billionaire by inheritance puts the lie to any notion that capitalism is a meritocratic system with equal opportunity.\n\nGoing back to the Walmart example, they have made certain \"pledges\" with regard to becoming carbon neutral etc - without carbon credits, good for them - by 2040. I have to wonder how much faster they'd get there if carbon was meaningfully taxed, or even better if the Walton family was convinced that they personally were just like everyone else on the planet and would be screwed by the climate catastrophes that are now kicking off."

At most it says that the richest 10% generate 50% of the worlds emissions and the richest 1% generate 16% of emissions. \n\nAnd like everyone else who reports Oxfam's results, this linked article gives absolutely no context on what it means to fall into the 1% and 10%, *or* the global poor.  Oxfam frames it in terms of billionaires, because that's what the people in the wealthy countries want to hear.  They desperately want to believe that, if just 3000 people\\* would behave themselves, the world would be saved.  Uh, no.\n\nFirst of all, this is what it means to be global poor:\n\n*Half of the global population lives on less than US$6.85 per person per day*\n\n*648 million people in the world, about eight percent of the global population, live in extreme poverty, which means they subsist on less than US$2.15 per day.*\n\n[https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day)\n\nAlready, you can see what the threshold for global wealthy is going to be.  +4 billion people surviving on $2500/year or less, with a subset of that group surviving on $785/year or less, means an overwhelmingly poor world.\n\nIn terms of income, what does it mean to fall into the 1%?  It's far from being a billionaire:\n\n*If you earn $60,000 a year after tax and you don\u2019t have kids, you\u2019re in the richest 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.*\n\n*If you have a household income of $130,000 after tax and you\u2019ve got a partner and one kid, you\u2019re also in the richest 1 percent.*\n\n*Or say you have a household income of $160,000 after tax and you\u2019ve got a partner and two kids. Guess what? You\u2019re also in the 1 percent.* \n\n[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich)\n\nOne article I once found described a typical 1%-er as being husband/wife schoolteachers in NY, both earning the state average teacher salary, with one child.\n\nAnd if that's all it takes to fall into the global 1%, imagine the incredibly small threshold for falling into the top 10%.  In terms of population, with the current world population estimated to be 8.2 billion, it's 820 million people.  The typical person living in a wealthy country like the US.  Or Canada.  Or England, or France, or Germany, or Australia, or...well, you get the point.\n\nOxfam is doing the entire world a disservice by publishing reports like this, because people in the wealthy countries see this and think, \"I don't have to change, it's the billionaires that have to change.\"  And you see this kind of remark repeated over and over in all of the environmental subreddits, including r/climate.  You see journalists repeat this in publications like The Guardian.\n\nAnd it's why we are so completely and thoroughly hosed.\n\n*\\*Some report 3194 billionaires, others report 2781, so I split the difference at 3000 as you did*"

All they can do is impact total oil emissions by producing less oil, and even though people claim they want less oil to be produced, they don't want their own oil usage to be reduced.\n\nOne of these days we're going to have to reckon with the way emissions have been reported is doing a lot of damage.  Combine the 70% figure (companies) with the 50% figure (richest 10%) and you get 120% of emissions.  In a society that's overwhelmingly scientifically illiterate, those two stats get bandied about as if they're somehow meaningful, but they can't both be true.\n\nEither individuals are responsible for their own emissions, which means we *all* have to work together to deal with the issue.  Or we keep blaming the companies, and we can all do whatever we want because it's only the companies that matter.\n\nBased on behavior, and the fact that we even blame the companies for the food we put into our own mouths when it comes to the obesity epidemic, we're going to keep blaming the companies (and the billionaires) until we go right off the cliff."

Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  \n* If you're replacing a car, get an EV\n* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible\n* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries\n* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer\n* Cut beef out of your diet, avoid cheese, and get as close to vegan as you can\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sure you are not mixing Norway and Denmark? \n\nDenmark does have some oil production (which in my opinion should be closed). But we are not a big industry within oil. We have a bigger windmill industry.\n\nIt is true Denmark is not as green as it brands itself. E.g., we have a high level of renewable energy but the individual Dane still have a very high environmental footprint. \n\nAnd the article is also a bit lame... since the average Dane is a big consumer of meat, it's a big work to change the mindset of people. But the government is spending money on these initiatives in the public sector. This is not only related to climate but also to health."

You are obviously mixing it up with Norway.\n\n\n\nNothing you write about our king is true. Like, fundamentally none of it. He was coronated last year, noone in the royal family has a 'real job' and the royal house is as well-funded as ever.\n\n\nConsumer debt in Denmark is higher than average primarily due to mortgage loans - gross debt is offset by substantial assets, including some of the worlds largest pensions and funding a massive social safety net. Danes are not struggling with debt, trust me.\n\n\nThe Danish national income average is freely available and is about on par with the rest of the western world. Anyone in Denmark who wants a pair of shoes can go down and buy one - rich or poor. I am amazed I have to type this. I owned like 5 pairs of shoes when I was a student and didn't have a job."

As has been pointed out ad nauseum, Americans will be the ones stuck with the increased prices on goods if those Trump tariffs (taxes) do go into effect.\n\nAt this point, if Donald told his cultists to fill up a bathtub, get inside of it, and then have someone drop a plugged-in toaster in the water with you, I bet a bunch of them would actually do it."

No. You get stagnant wages for decade after decade while literally tens of trillions of dollars accumulate in the hands of the top 1%.\n\nIf you are an environmentalist and you aren't anti-capitalist then you aren't serious or you aren't thinking straight."

A single house getting them greatly improves the odds of everybody in the neighborhood getting them. Likewise with friends and relatives.\n\nAnd then once a house has them, they are way more likely to switch from gas to electric utilities and specifically heat pumps. And if they're car-reliant, they're more likely to switch to electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids.\n\nAnd even just having panels plus an active monitoring app, they are more likely to do helpful load-shifting for the grid.\n\n\nAnd yes, obviously one house doesn't do anything, but this is spreading and nobody I know who has done this wants to go back once they have it. Organically, people can self-fund a helpful amount of collective change, while we're all waiting on larger scale utility level projects, policy changes, mitigating meat methane, transcontinental shipping, etc."

Increased energy consumption adds heat to the environment, consumes mineral resources that are not renewables and allows people to continue to think we don't ever need to cut back on consumption.

We've risen \\~25cm in sea level over preindustrial average so far, and that leads to false hope (because that rise has been fairly slow over the last 150 years, and sea level rise lags well behind the temps which might be assumed to cause it), but the present lack of devastation should not lull anyone into having an inaccurate picture of the future.\n\nDon't worry about the difference between a 99 year lease and a direct purchase of land below 70m above sea levels."

The [IPCC AR6 estimates of sea level rise](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool?type=global) are even worst than that. Almost all of them are ridiculously low according to the satellite measurements.\n\nThe [accurate satellite measurements of sea level rise](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01761-5/figures/1) show the current rate of increase is 4.5 mm/year and this rate is increasing by 0.077 mm/year. Doing simple math that gives about 0.7 m by 2100. This is likely a minimum possible sea level rise. If we look at the estimated ranges from AR6 some are entirely below 0.7 m. For me the satellite measurements falsify all the ranges with a lower estimate below 0.7 m by 2100. Being generous maybe the very highest of the 7 estimated ranges might be plausible: SSP5-8.5 Low Confidence. The other 6 are just nonsense."

US manufacturing isn't coming back and it shouldn't because americans by and large are lazy and entitled and won't produce the same quality of product let alone at the same price. Labor is too expensive here to ever compete and most of our people are uneducated and unskilled by comparison. People in general here just think they're more important and worth a lot more than they actually are. They believe wages are too low because they live such wasteful, extravagant lives and don't even realize it. Taxes and insurance premiums play a role in that too. We have a lot of bureaucratic rot at all levels (especially local which no one pays attention to) and we're over-insured and under-educated on how we can prevent accidents & bad health outcomes so we don't need as much insurance in the first place."

Even though we have several dealerships in the city and some friends have them, I\u2019m still not ready to buy them since I\u2019m not sure about post service and resale, maybe in a couple of years they\u2019re  going to be very costly to repair or there\u2019s going to be supply issues, not willing to gamble."

Solar is now, today in 2024, THE CHEAPEST form of energy generation and it doesn't have any of the downsides nuclear has in terms of safety, pollution and scalability.

Rich guy won't visit without electricity, won't visit if none of the cafes have been rebuilt, etc. Once the damage passes a certain point, it's no longer a fun vacation spot. And then the wealthy abandon it.\n\nThe city on Maui which had a wildfire run through it will be the same. For this first wildfire, it'll get rebuilt by rich people, because Maui is fun. But if the problems exceed the area's capacity to repair, then it's not fun any more, and the rich will abandon it and suddenly it'll be nothing but climate refugees."

Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/americans-are-willing-to-pay-177-annually-for-carbon-tax-survey-finds). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own. A carbon tax is [widely regarded](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0474-0.epdf?author_access_token=tst1A-oZnQ8zUO18wGGPQdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nfy3PIgvrwnNXQzIbXH8z1Wkqhm6g5NiMnxMk__ebsKxGQNB0hMf1Vpo-ZiNplSt5LeLyks-Q3sdrpBdfxxHvAfQylqqwqHxgEml7GEGOxaQ%3D%3D) as the single most impactful climate mitigation policy.\n\n[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level). \n\nTaxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (it [saves lives at home](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x)) and [many nations have already started](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the \"rich\" can afford fossil fuels in the first place. We [won\u2019t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224); the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).\n\n\u00a7 The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with \"high confidence\" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf). It is literally [Econ 101](http://sites.bu.edu/manove-ec101/files/2014/10/EC101Outlines14-Externalities.pdf). The idea [won a Nobel Prize](http://environment.yale.edu/news/article/william-nordhaus-wins-nobel-prize-for-economics-of-climate-change/). Thanks to researchers at MIT, you can see for yourself how it compares with other mitigation policies [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/carbontax/comments/1flb05b/i_used_mits_climate_policy_simulator_to_order_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)."

A lot of climate change is going to happen no matter what right now, so that inflation is already baked into a lot of future scenarios. In the meantime there's so much up and down price movement in raw crop prices, it'll be hard to maintain credibility about that sort of claim. \n\nThere has to be a plan for selling \"addressing climate change\" at the same time as offering a BETTER standard of living for most people. Making it clear sustainable living is preferable by a lot of the metrics people already recognize - income security, housing, food availability, leisure time, etc... - which is all absolutely achievable as long as progressive economics are a central part of those strategies."

                "Content": "\"Do you think it is possible that there might be so many cheaters today because we have been reinforcing for a couple of generations, a neo-liberal economic model of human behavior that suggests \"greed is good\"?\"\n\nThis is precisely what I'm saying but your solution is wrong. The only way to survive in a cheating economy is by developing an ability to cheat. It's not even only neo-liberal economies. But before neoliberal economies you had various other types of economy come on many of which were naturally cooperative in nature come up but they didn't survive colonization, Empires etc\n\nYou cannot fix a cheating society by using cooperation. Because at some point a cheat will enter that co-operative and destroy it by cheating. Even the internet was started on cooperativeist grounds, built entirely on Trust. Obviously self-interest entered the space in Web 2.0 and has finished it permanently. Now we have a situations where different countries around the world are creating their own localized versions of internet that can't even be bypassed by VPN.\n\nThat's just one example. What's worse, it's mathematically provable you can prove that through both Monte Carlo and analytical methods. But nobody likes basically being told that they are nothing but a mathematical model. Even though the whole baseline of algorithms do exactly that. Echo Chambers are an emergent behaviour resulting from the formulation of mathematical models. \n\nAnd crucially perhaps, because of the way people do not understand those dynamical realities common every one of the proposed futuristic models, ignores the realities of current Society, assume the completely blank slate and thinks that if a projects far enough into the future, at some point it will be correct. But the trouble is nobody lives long enough to ever be able to validate it. Making it what is basically an utterly pointless exercise. \n\nThis is not needed with what is basically in-silico simulations, which has been tested against historical data or analytical proofs of attractors in the system that will always pull towards it. To simplify what I'm saying, there is no point in trying to constructively prove that every single number plus 0 is the number itself. \n\n1+0=1\n2+0=2\n...\n\nIf you tried to constructively prove that. You'll be here till the end of time and beyond. Which of course common new human can live long enough to see and what's worse, someone just had to add one more number to where you stop and you've got to prove it all over again for that one number. \n\nMathematical induction on the other hand comma analytically allows you to prove that without having to construct every number. And this is why it's important to be mathematically literate, so you can determine the proof of things like Aspen. And because Aspen falls over even in the base case (ie if it applies now) it relies on a completely blank slate for humans. Which means no existing human can exist in that world and therefore requires a complete destruction of humanity as a species comma and then the spontaneous evolution of humanity again has a species. Which isn't going to happen because that's not possible. Given the fitness function of the environment has changed or the factors humans will not go extinct and therefore never clear out the old world"

However, no one is stopping the self-satisfied idiots who are creating these Frankenstinian monsters, so we can be sure that AI will define our future, or possibly end it altogether.\n\nAnd what of the global chaos that the fossil fuels industry is now creating to delay its demise?

These fossil-fueled bullies create mayhem to distract the public from the climate crisis, sowing fear, rage, and mistrust of the very institutions we now need more than ever.

Other zoonotic diseases will become very bad things in the future.  Diseases jumping to humans is rare.   The recent weird bird flu has a high fatality rate among farm workers who got it, quite high.  If something like that became airborne the situation could be very serious indeed, magnitudes worse than COVID.\n\nMeat production will increase 50% by 2050 to meet rising demand.  Aside from the emissions and other climate problems this meat production will cause, the risk of zoonotic diseases jumping to humans will increase as well. \n\n\"Bacon tho.\""

Throw oil at the people who love it and enable it so much its killing the planet. If the oil industry topples it will definitely shake up and cripple the economy but lol better that than mass extinction. \n\nThe more safe but difficult way would be to hold a strike of such immense scale that the government cannot essentially wave it off as a treehugger hippy movement and ignore it. The 1975 Iceland strike for womens rights involved 90% of female population flat out refusing to work and walked out - 220,000 women attended the public rally that day. The next year their government passed the law ensuring equal rights. Its beyond impressive.\n\nThe question is - Would it be possible to organise such a large scale strike / walk out event when we have so many people desperate to argue that the warming climate and natural disasters are normal, one off freak accidents? Would 90% of your countrymen strike for this cause? Especially when the govenrment and the oil industry is actively trying to silence the criticism and convince people that fossil fuel is a necessary industry? Uggggghhhhh"

If someone is allergic to one of the foods that are vegan compatible, they can avoid that specific food and still thrive on a plant based diet.  There are very few people who can only tolerate nothing but animal products in their diets.\n\nThe largest organization of nutrition professionals had this to say on the topic.\n\n>Abstract\n\n\"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of cancer, and obesity. Low intake of saturated fat and high intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, soy products, nuts, and seeds (all rich in fiber and phytochemicals) are characteristics of vegetarian and vegan diets that produce lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and better serum glucose control. These factors contribute to reduction of chronic disease. Vegans need reliable sources of vitamin B-12, such as fortified foods or supplements.\"\n\n  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/)"

The issue is that lots of light must be delivered to plants in order to create the biomass for the calorie-rich foods that actually feed humanity. Sunlight at midday lights the field by something like 1 kW per square meter, which you're looking to replace in artificial way. It averages to about 300 W per square meter over a day. If you stack layers of plants vertically, you still need to deliver that sort of light for each layer. By even the most modest and optimistic back of the envelope calculations, cost of staples would increase by factor of 10 because electricity generation costs so much."

In this regard, it is not a completely independent sovereign nation making decisions alone. Anyone arguing otherwise here is likely either lying, an agent working at an information warfare/PR desk, or ignorant. As the U.S. has been essentially running a protection racket for the *[House of Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud)*, the controlling family of Saudi Arabia, for well over half a century.\n\nThe U.S. supplies them with weapons, and who knows what other security and intelligence-related services, and they in turn manipulate oil market conditions on behalf of the U.S. Whether that be [selling the vast majority of their oil in U.S. Treasury-denominated debt instruments](https://archive.ph/pOaX1) like Treasury Bonds or [constricting/glutting global oil markets](https://archive.is/Wv63m#selection-1277.0-1293.222). \n\nAs an example: the U.S. and other states consume and sell the oil they produce nearly instantaneously. What Saudi Arabia has, no one else does; extremely high volumes of reserves that can be drilled, basically, on command:\n\n> [...] what matters most for stabilizing global oil prices is \u201cspare production capacity\u201d\u2014defined as how much a producer can ramp up oil production within 30 days. That spare production capacity allows a producer to ramp up\u2014or slow down\u2014oil production basically at will, shifting global prices.\n> \n> Saudi Arabia has a huge amount of spare production capacity: around [2 million barrels of oil](https://archive.ph/gDnRs) a day. Once, the United States did have spare production capacity that was managed by the [Texas Railroad Commission](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-factbox/factbox-opec-still-standing-among-the-ruins-of-former-cartels-idUSKCN0YO243/). But as more easily reached oil dried up\u2014to be replaced by harder-to-reach shale oil\u2014that power disappeared. Today, the United States\u2019 spare production capacity is zero. U.S. oil producers, many of whom are beholden to their shareholders, can\u2019t hold on to spare capacity in the same way as their Middle East counterparts.\n>  \n> Spare production capacity \u201cis expensive to maintain, which is why no other producers maintain it,\u201d said Hittle. In the U.S., she added, investors would never put up with spending capital to develop production and then letting it sit idle until the right moment.\n>  \n> Source: [The U.S. is the world\u2019s largest oil producer. You\u2019ll still pay more for gas.](https://archive.ph/BM0we#selection-1085.20-1155.261)\u2014By  Shannon Osaka | Oct. 8, 2022 (*The Washington Post*)\n\nTheir decisions can, and often do, set the market price for oil. Just based on how much they decide to produce, or most often, not produce. They don't even need OPEC to move it.\n\nIn this way, Saudi Arabia really acts as a kind of back door Federal Reserve. Because they sell their oil almost exclusively in dollars, if their decisions shoot the price of oil to the moon because they restricted supply, a lot of the dollar money supply is going to be sucked out of circulation. And this is exactly what happened during the 1970s oil shocks, and leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, where oil topped out at $150 a barrel in the Summer of that year. They can pull a lot of money out of the system. Almost overnight. **Single-handedly**. So, anyone arguing here that Saudi Arabia is acting purely in its own self-interest in regard to impeding climate change-related policy that could potentially place supply and demand restrictions on oil is 100% full of it.\n\nAs stated above, the U.S. has been using it's protection racket \"relationship\" with the House of Saud now for half a century, and more fundamentally, [since World War II](https://archive.ph/fsg85). This isn't some rogue state acting all on it's own... because muhhnayyy. **This is about U.S. power and leverage over the geopolitical landscape.**"

                "Content": "Another recent book that is about climate change - although more about the current state and how it will affect migration and our food sources along with the migration of Americans to areas that they may perhaps survive is called, On the Move by [Abrahm Lustgarten](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_audible_1?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=Abrahm+Lustgarten&search-alias=audible).  This pretty much sums up the book, but I highly recommend getting a copy to keep for future reference: On the Move by Abrahm Lustgarten is a welcome addition to the growing library of what humans face in regard to the world\u2019s changing climate conditions. On the Move is more of a sociological treatise on why people are moving/migrating, and where are their destinations. The three main vectors Lustgarten projects for the impetus of migration are: heat/drought/water crisis, and crop failure; heat and resulting fires; flooding, due to rising sea levels, tides and storms, in particular tropical storms/hurricanes.  \n  \nLustgarten selects Central America and California as his initial targets. Simply put, Central Americans are abandoning their farms as drought has rendered their fields barren. Hunger is a great motivation for moving, and the author provides a few examples citing individual journeys, as well as the perils of large groups moving toward the US border through Mexico. Mexico is caught between a rock and a hard place with migrants pouring in while the United States is critical about the migrants working their way to the Mexico-US border. In California, increasing heat and dryness fans wildfires that threaten or destroy entire communities. The Eden that once was is going up in smoke. Additionally, the Colorado River serves an enormous population in the southwestern United States, as well as industrial agriculture. The demands upon the water provided by the Colorado River are reaching a tipping point, in particular, if snows in the Rocky Mountains are not significant enough. If it\u2019s decided agriculture wins, what happens to the people.  \n  \nLustgarten transitions to the southern states, Louisiana in particular. Flooding from sea level rise, storm surges, uninsurable properties disproportionately affecting the poor, and to compound the issue, from Louisiana and all other southern states in this same boat, the wealthy are able to move, whereas the poor cannot afford to do so. Urban areas such as Atlanta are expecting major population increases but lack the infrastructure to accept the coming flood of people. In both California and southern states bordering the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, commercial insurance companies want to bail out. States have taken over in some instances, in order to keep people in place, even if calamities are recurrent. People vote.  \n  \nSo where is everybody going to go? Lustgarten strongly hints that a second migration is nearly upon us, where heat, fire, and lack of water will drive people from the western sunbelt, and heat and too much water will drive people back to the \u201cRust Belt\u201d. Temperatures will remain moderate, and the Great Lakes combined contain about 25% of the world\u2019s fresh water. Duluth, Minnesota in particular is a \u201cClimate Oasis\u201d along with Detroit, Michigan could easily absorb many migrants from climate extremes, but does an infrastructure exist to accommodate the possible coming hordes. Is the government lax in preparing, or might preparing spawn panic? How will migrants within the United States be received? As heat continues to have effect on water supply and living conditions, will there be a further stratification of society, in particular between the haves and have nots? Will air conditioning be available to all, or be unaffordable to many?  \n  \nLustgarten paints a picture of the future that can have dire consequences for many if not all people.  \nI recommend reading Lustgarten\u2019s On the Move, as well as Jeff Goodell\u2019s The Heat Will Kill You First, and David Archer\u2019s The Long Thaw. Goodell\u2019s book informs the reader on how heat affects life in general and people in particular, and Archer\u2019s book provides the science of accumulating CO2 in the atmosphere and its ramifications. The three books provide enough insight into the crisis to come if we continue to not take the looming climate crisis seriously."

Generally that bad faith was gratingly dishonest in the 1970s when it was flogged by Ralph Nader's PIRG people, and it became dishonest on the other side in the 1990s when long term ice core data showed that there was no plausible shift in the variance of the data that might mean we are looking at a a temporary random chance in the pattern."

Corrective action after the fact is much more costly and intrusive than preventive action.\u201d\n\n>...Not all consequences of crossing tipping points are reversible. Wildlife and ecosystems lost to prolonged environmental shifts may never recover, and certain changes could demand more effort to undo than what caused them initially. This asymmetry complicates restoration efforts.\n\nThe [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-024-00768-1) attempts to quantify the cost of restoring sea ice compared to the cost of preserving it.  What is more important is that the loss of global energy-balance stability is so complex and impossible to predict that the basis of all economic value and the ability to support life becomes a deep unknown.  This study is simply an attempt to find a quantifiable thread in the unraveling.  The strength of the argument will be evaluated solely based on the vantage point of the evaluator.  Those who control existing wealth and power cannot afford to acknowledge that their business-as-usual projections are fraudulent.  They will find arguments like that made in this study unconvincing.  That is the problem."

Best, most effective, and cheapest, is to cut emissions drastically, rework our economic system, restore forests, grasslands, etc, and mitigate the peaks of the environmental ride we are now on.  Eventually this will settle back into the natural cycles determined by orbitals cycles and where oceans and mountains are, but no matter what it will take a long time and be difficult.\n\nThing is everyone wants a fast magic fix that doesn\u2019t require making any radical changes to the current economic system, and as long as that mentality holds we are completely screwed.\n\nPretty much every proposed geoengineering project brings with it an enormous raft of negative consequences that either exacerbate the climate and environmental problems, or introduce new ones."

They need help understanding how inconsiderate they've been, when they only enjoy the luxury they do thanks to the hard work of generations past, leading to worlds where knowledgeable creatures created the conditions for their riches to be made possible to enjoy. Now they enjoy them from up high, with power, while the world degrades beneath them. Enough of us are now well aware of what's really at stake here ..  lost opportunities, wasted knowledge that brought us such amazing things ..  at risk of living in a bleak and frightening future suffering in so many ways, no longer distracted and held over by the things we're able to enjoy that insulate us from the natural world, and the real world, like we are now, caught up in our jobs and the sensations provided by the array of stimulus before us. This all while we know better and consistently have the opportunity to do better. Things panned out this way but they don't have to remain this way. The costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of taking action, to organize and infiltrate the minds of the ignorant masses in a show of community, in understanding everything is affected by the direction we take at times when we have to be serious and thoughtful about how to navigate the future. These are times to think outside the box on how to overcome these barriers, and collectively acknowledge our undignified behaviors in pursuit of a better way, allowing each other flexibility and providing tools and compassion for growth. \n\nThey may not feel it but they know the cost of their actions, and how exceptional their lives are, and what it means to live in luxury while the world burns. We need to clearly communicate that we care and it isn't fair. It isn't right. This is all really happening and we can really impact the way the future unfolds.\n\nI wish people understood how amazing and extraordinary our existence is, and the progress weve made. To advance to a point with allllllll these cool things ... Movies, music galore, medicine, technology ... All in service to us. We're brilliant. Why are we acting so silly about things right now, especially when the trade off is so morally reprehensible? We can't be that consumed by everything to be unable to stop this machine and think."

                "Content": "Thanks for asking!  Here is my standard answer (copy paste)\n\nGandhi regularly wrote about the need for training. Something like \"Soldiers do a lot of training to learn to kill. So we have to train at least that hard to make change WITHOUT killing.\" Well OK, I can't say I've ever trained as hard as soldiers.  But the point is that training really helps. Reach out to area NGOs, especially in big cities, asking about workshops for wannabe activists. Can't find any? Ask the your library or churches about using a meeting space. Keep calling nearby larger cities looking for someone who will come out to do a workshop just for your group.  Meanwhile here are some thoughts\n\nBusinesses launch campaigns using the GOST model..... activists take note!  Passion is nice, but it will fizzle if it is not grounded in GOST-based planning.  So google \"GOST Model\"\n\nGood book: [*This is an Uprising*](http://thisisanuprising.org/)\n\nUseful resource:  [The Indivisible Guide](https://indivisible.org/democracy-guide)\n\nInstead of organizing as a 501C3,  google \"activist affinity groups\".  <<< Much better way to sustain long term passion.  Most sudden political catharsis turns out people processing the immediate trauma.  They show up and several creative bold souls point the way.  But what usually happens is a few in the group say \"We gotta get this *organized*\"  And they goof because they mistakenly think the legal BS of 501c3 status, with its bylaws and officers, makes an *effective* tool for substantive social change. We need a *movement*, not a bureaucracy. Sometimes the people who push formal 501c3 format genuinely mean well. Sometimes they seem to be party members who take the officer positions to keep the surging passion of the group under party control... which usually leads to it fizzling out.\n\nHowever you do it, here are the top three tips from a 30-some year professor who studied social change. (I heard this in the middle of the night driving back from the DC Women's March, don't recall her name, or details of the radio program.  She said the top three tips are\n\n1. Always keep the high road\n2. Despite the validity of \"intersectionality\", for effective organizing stick to a SINGLE issue\n3. Stay away from online organizing and do it face to face.  Do actions in person.  Use screens to support those efforts rather than as a substitute for them\n\nSome good movies (docudramas)\n\n* Gandhi(1982)\n* Iron-Jawed Angels (2004)\n* Selma (2014)\n\nDumbledore to a self-doubthing Harry, \"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\"\n\nGandalf to a despairing Frodo, who said he wished the ring had never come to him, \"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.\"\n\nUnknown (and it wasn't Edmund Burke), \"All that is necessary for evil to prevail is that good men and women  do nothing.\"\n\nGood luck, and Go get 'em!!"

And before we had developed a culture to process this new stream of information (i.e., contextualizing it, evaluating it, and moderating our own reaction to it) we invented television. \n\nYou can see how warped the oldest generations are by television news. We're only barely processing how warped the younger generations are by internet/social media. \n\nMy opinion is that our collective reliance on abstract information has become so dominant that -- at least for some people -- even the urgent reality of flooding, hurricanes, and wildfires is not enough to claw their minds back from this space of abstract meaning. \n\nI've been in the climate space for a long time now and I used to think that reality would snap people back from their delusions. But when people are attacking FEMA workers and targeting weather radars, I have to admit I think the delusional commitment to the abstract narrative can be more powerful than the immediate reality."

Perhaps if we have enough hurricanes, crop failures and forest fires, people will stop supporting conspiracy nuts and greedy corporations as they can see the actual damage to local communities and empty lies from the ones they follow.\n\nOur minds are all forged from capitalism and right now a lot of us are just buying from the leaders offering the best \"deal\", which is finger pointing and believing conspiratorial alternatives. There may come a time when that ends, but how much damage will be done before that happens?"

But we also have a bunch of other instincts, and there isn't anything to show that greed is stronger than something like, say, altruism, in a neutral environment. There's some studies involving rats that show altruism is in fact a pretty strong motivator. So I'd agree with jrtf83 that the problem is not that humans are greedy, but that we have a system that incentivises greed and disincentivises things like generosity and altruism. It would be dope to have an economic and political system that helps us be the best versions of ourselves."

Yes, if the entirety of the world consumed like the wealthy do (including in countries where most people aren't wealthy), it would be the issue. But as Chuhaimaster pointed out below, population growth slows as countries reach a 'higher' levels of development. So one way to slow population growth that some people are so scared of would be to stop the net flow of resources and wealth from the periphery to the core and allow those countries to utilise their own resources for their own people to, for example, increase access to education for women which has a profound effect on birth rate.\n\nBut even more importantly, the wealthiest 10% of individuals contribute 90% of emissions (more or less). I'm sure you've seen the graph that originated I think with Oxfam. The bulk of emissions come from the core and it's the core that needs to deal with it."

She did this because she's entrenched in a particular kind of politics that is very interested in protesting a lot but not interested in organizing the political will of voters. \n\nIf she had made a definitive statement on who to vote for it would have impacted her clout among many of these leftists, and for that she is a coward."

                "Content": "A few years ago there were some studies released that explored the connection between a collapse of thermohaline circulation and a hypothetical subsequent acceleration of warming and abrupt glacial termination. I assume they didn't get much publicity as they went against the ridiculous \"AMOC collapse to cause new ice age\" narrative, but it's somewhat well understood that a collapse of the AMOC has a direct impact on the ocean's ability to absorb excess atmospheric heat and carbon and can result in oceanic carbon outgassing. Supplementary hypotheses have also stated that a collapse of thermohaline circulation could be an indication of an approaching greenhouse transitional event, and that a drastic warming of the polar regions is a consequence and and an accelerant rather than a prelude.\n\nVarious academic teams such as Ridgwell, Turner et al., Tripati, Elderfield et al. and Abbot, Haley et al. have explored paleoclimate evidence for a major disruption of thermohaline circulation and subsequent extreme warming events. So essentially, we may very well be at the point where a collapse of the AMOC actually causes a more severe warming trajectory worldwide due to its atmospheric regulative properties vastly outweighing its poleward distributive properties. We've essentially altered the atmosphere to the point that excess heat and carbon completely overrides icehouse dynamics."

Personally, I've quite liked the effects of the IRA, and that's been pretty much THE climate legislation in this administration."

We even saw [major cuts to the leasing of federal lands for coal](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251856806/biden-ending-new-leases-in-americas-top-coal-region), as well as [big cuts to oil and gas leasing](https://imgur.com/biden-has-leased-few-acres-to-oil-gas-companies-vmuUCzY)\n\nBy contrast, Trump [appointed a coal lobbyist to run the EPA](https://www.citizen.org/news/the-coal-lobbyist-now-running-the-environmental-protection-agency/)  and [took steps to increase not just greenhouse gas emissions, but a wide variety of human-impacting pollutants](https://archive.is/hCxSk), is surrounded by people who [want to eliminate any effort to address the climate problem](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf), and [solicited a billion-dollar bribe from the oil industry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/)\n\nHarris may not have done enough *yet* and some of the language she uses about fossil fuel extraction is designed to appeal to people who still depend on oil to get to work, but the choice is very clear.  [Vote](https://iwillvote.com) for Harris &mdash; and [volunteer if you can](https://go.kamalaharris.com)"

                "Content": "The title is misleading. CO2 migrated around the casing of a monitoring well from the storage location about 10,000 feet deep to a location about 5,000 feet deep. The issue was spotted, and the monitoring well was plugged, and the CO2 will remain at that depth for thousands of years. We learn from things like this, and I expect you\u2019ll see more stringent material requirements on monitoring wells such as high chromium steel. Btw, water table depth is a hundred feet or so. This CO2 poses no threat as the backup systems in place functioned exactly as intended.\n\nAs an aside, CO2 is found underground naturally at high concentrations in many parts of the world. It doesn\u2019t leak out because it is contained under impermeable cap rock layers. These same kinds of layers are used to store CO2 that we put underground. We\u2019ve been effectively storing CO2 underground since the 1970s when enhanced oil recovery operations started kicking off.\n\nEdit: Feel free to pass this through ChatGPT if you think I\u2019m being dishonest. I\u2019m not here to mislead anyone."

On the plus side, it's carbon sequestration which doesn't involve other significant emissions or really much input at scale.  On the negative side, it is a model which is dependent on extremely rare geography - but which might be applicable to other places with significant hot spots, like near Yellowstone.  Also on the negative side, it's really small - if all the places in the world which could do this, did do this, it would still be not close to enough.  But every little bit helps!  Stuff like this, combined with serious emission reduction, might be a way to have climate change be a problem of decades rather than centuries or longer\n\nGeneral CC using grid power might forever be a scam, though."

Thanks for sharing\n\nI think carbon sequestration is the only long term solution to engineer the climate - and hopefully goes without saying that all the other steps to eliminate emissions etc are essential. \n\nStill, even if we stop all emissions, we need to reduce the carbon already in the air, and every passing day of emissions makes that problem worse. At this point it is not possible to plant enough trees to do this, so we do need industrial sequestration\n\nThe question is if we can trust the oil companies to actually do it in a green way"

I asked him how he determined this ?  His reply was \u201cbecause none of them were leaking, and we always have leakers\u201d. My reply was that if the repairs and settings on the valves was done as per stated on the work manifests, they should go back onto the manifolds they are assigned to and not leak, unless there is an over pressure in the manifold.  This is how that methane/natural gas escapes into the atmosphere. Therefore leakers are just bad rebuilds and settings and shouldn\u2019t be tolerated.

Someone has to empty it once in a while, but the law where the majority of the problems in the world are caused by very few bad actors is true.\n\nThen there is the one from Malcom gladwell\u2019s new book that a huge percentage of car emissions come from just 1 percent of cars that are either old or \u201ctuned\u201d. And that if we targeted these cars, and enforced the emissions regulations like we do speeding (and we have the sensors for it) we could do the same for air pollution as replacing like half of the cars on the road with electric."

In transport by pipe - yes, but again you have to carefully review all along the pipe because the gas release won\u2019t be obvious- IR cameras again. If the gas is used as LNG, the process of chilling it till liquid, transporting across ocean, restoring to gas and then pumping into pipelines it\u2019s just a matter of how careful you are at each stage. I believe the European gas network is better monitored for leaks than the American, but that\u2019s a low bar. \nMy reading on the subject suggests using methane we get from fracking to power our own plants is a good use and we can bring the leaks down. Exporting US LNG is inefficient and not a good idea except that Russia deciding to screw the Eurozone by using their own gas as a strategic weapon cannot be allowed to succeed. We need to tax carbon, the sooner we do, the sooner the incentives will align for renewables like solar and wind and maybe even nuclear."

Emissions per mile traveled will then vary based on the MPG of the car.\n\nThe other pollutants are still really important, but not because of the climate impact.  The other pollutants cause major respiratory health issues and haze.  Think Los Angeles in the 1980's, or Denver today.\n\nAnother major source of these pollutants is gas-powered lawn equipment, as those aren't equipped with emissions control devices.  So when you hear about a small number of vehicles (or lawn equipment) causing the majority of pollutants, they're referring to things like PM 2.5, NOx, etc."

There isn't. It's a response specifically reserved for China.\n\n> I trust the Biden administration over Xi's brutal authoritarian dictatorship which has proven time and again they do not act in good faith. \n\nOk, so that means that you *don't* trust US emissions figures between 2017 and 2020 then? \n\n> The US has an incredible amount of regulation and transparency comparatively. \n\nDo you have a citation with analysis on that?\n\n> China, and the world, seem to hold themselves to a different standard while they greenwash their emissions \n\nDo they? How so?\n\n> and paint themselves as some kind of climate leader, all while being the world\u2019s worst polluter. \n\nChina is a country of 1.4 billion people, it's the largest manufacturer and exporter in the world and it only started industrialisation about 50 years ago. It's hardly surprising that it is the biggest polluter. \n\n> China's annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 exceed those of all other countries combined. \n\nNo, they don't. They were about a third of global emissions.\n\n> China accounted for 95% of the world's new coal power construction activity in 2023, and construction of new plants is up four-fold since 2019. I could go on. \n\nNo it didn't.\n\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-just-15-countries-account-for-98-of-new-coal-power-development/\n\nAnd its a very selective framing to measure progress this way. I could point to the massive expansion of natural gas, especially dirty fracked gas, and doubly dirty LNG produced from fracked gas that the US is committed to.\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gas-production-by-country?country=~USA\n\nhttps://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/news-content-hub/north-american-lng-exports-set-for-massive-expansion-82654#:~:text=North%20America%20has%20become%20a,around%20181%20mtpa%20by%202028.\n\nIt also ignores the fact that while China has built more coal-fired power plants, it is actually switching its coal-fired plants on less every year.\n\nhttps://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/china-coal-plants\n\n> I work in finance and have seen time and again how China creates narratives and data to artificially inflate how good their economy and GDP is doing, or their real estate sector, etc. This is partially to appear strong on the world stage and attract foreign investment. When you have a culture that prioritizes saving face and 'eating bitterness', and a dictator that cannot be criticized or made to look weak to his people or the world, then China\u2019s system incentivizes local governments and industry to fudge their numbers, and this widespread corruption means China\u2019s economic success is inflated. This applies to all aspects of life and demographics in China, including their renewable energy sector. \n\nAre you saying that they aren't actually building the solar and wind projects they say they say they are? These things are directly observable from satellites. Not to mention, many have international investors who might get a bit upset if the 20MW turbines they invested in didn't actually materialise.\n\nWhat you actually have here is some cultural prejudices, a biased and skewed understanding of the data and no actual evidence that the analysis by Carbon Brief is wrong.\n\n> So as you can tell I am very skeptical of the country and the numbers their government provides.\n\nCarbon emissions are verifiable from space. These inventories are not just accepted without critical analysis. Get some data. Leave your prejudices at the door."

All he can really do is try to sign executive orders or work with his cabinet to try to change a few things, but unfortunately, most of it can be easily reversed by Trump. Republicans in Congress successfully hindered climate policy for both Obama and Biden.\n\nIn just two months, Republicans will control the President and Executive branch, both chambers of Congress, the Supreme Court, and a majority of state legislatures and governor seats.\n\nWe need to accept the grim reality that US climate policy will be absolutely screwed for at least the next two years. I could spend 30 minutes listing all the damage they will do, from shutting down renewable projects, starting new drilling projects, exiting the Paris climate accords, re-allocating transportation funding away from transit and bike/pedestrian projects to highway expansion, privatizing forests, you name it.\n\nIf you care at all about our future, please get involved in politics. Please vote in every election in the future. Make climate change your #1 issue. Don't do stupid things like abstain from voting because of Palestine. The Republican party needs to be completely voted away from any majority."

She\u2019s been a driving force in delivering the strongest climate action in history, and she\u2019s ready to build on those gains from day one as president.\n  \nTwo years ago this summer, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote that secured U.S. Senate passage of the strongest climate action in history \u2013 climate and clean energy incentives worth at least $370 billion over 10 years in the Inflation Reduction Act. She has also been a driving force to ensure that the solutions are equitable and address the unfair pollution and health burdens that our nation\u2019s front-line communities have suffered.\n  \nHarris has worked for environmental justice for two decades, starting after she was elected district attorney for San Francisco and, later, attorney general for California. She created one of the first environmental justice units in San Francisco and held oil companies and automakers accountable for their pollution.\n  \nFormer President Trump, on the other hand, waged the worst White House attack ever against the environment and public health while in office. And he has made clear that his second term will be even more extreme, drawing from the detailed anti-environment proposals and plans contained in Project 2025. Every vote for Dr. Jill Stein or Cornel West instead of Kamala Harris makes it more likely that Donald Trump will win.\n  \nWe share your commitment to a safe and healthy environment for all and thank Stein and West for raising important issues in this election, but Vice President Harris is the only candidate with a record of success addressing climate change. Please join us in voting for the Harris-Walz ticket and against the Trump-Vance pro-polluter ticket.\n  \nSincerely,\n350 Action\nCenter for Biological Diversity Action Fund\nClimate Emergency Advocates\nEarthjustice Action\nFood and Water Action\nFriends of the Earth Action\nLeague of Conservation Voters\nNRDC Action Fund\nSierra Club\nSunrise Movement"

I have seen estimates that put this number as high as 15,000 billion metric tons when considering offshore storage opportunities. Globally, the CO2 storage capacity has been estimated to be as high as 55,000 billion metric tons.\n\nWe need to vastly expand the CO2 pipeline network if we are going to have a chance of fixing this. \"Oh but the risk of leaks!\" Yes, this is true, but we've been transporting CO2 via pipeline since the 70s, and there have been limited incidents with essentially no direct fatalities. Try saying that about cars or practically anything else that we engage with daily (walking up/down stairs, eating, etc...). The risk is nonzero but exceedingly low. Ignoring the fact that we learn from these incidents, you have to ask yourself the question, \"Do I want the risk of a temporary CO2 leak from a pipeline or the certainty of climate catastrophe from doing nothing.\" \n\nI strongly support the parallel rollout of zero carbon energy sources, but the reality is that we can't do it fast enough to ignore point source carbon capture, and even if we could, we would still need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. This isn't the only solution, but without it, failure is guaranteed. At least it gives us a chance to return to pre-industrial CO2 levels."

We should focus on point source capture first, but once we\u2019re controlling those emissions fully, we might achieve 1 billion metric tons of atmospheric removal in the span of a couple of decades, assuming supportive policy. At a modest rate of improvement, it is easy to envision 10 billion metric tons per year within a few more decades. By the turn of the century, we might be approaching 20 or more billion metric tons of removal annually. Then it\u2019s just a matter of continuous expansion to chip away at the atmospheric CO2 over the span of another hundred years or so. I think our grandchildren will be well on their way to having preindustrial air quality. It\u2019s going to take a lot of work, but we must start now with point source capture, investment in pipeline infrastructure, and CO2 injection hubs."

Regardless, the original copy of bills are created by congress which Harris was not a member of at the time, and it wasnt even in the final bill. Youre probably the first person I've ever hear disparage a bill because a problematic portion was removed before final passage. \n\nIm not a fan of tarrifs either, but those tarrifs were intended to protect domestic manufacturing of EVs. Btw if youre really concerned with the Climate it may interest you to know that one of the largest sources of pollution is cross ocean shipping (and thats before talking about the negative impacts to marine ecosystems) so yes tarrifs on chineese EVs which are produced with dirtier electricity, and then shipped at the epense of tons of CO2 should be discouraged in place of domestic manufacturing. \n\nSo at this point i think i can safely assume youre not ill informed, its clear you are trying to pish a very specific message here.

Care to guess where those donations are coming from? The other two candidates have a combined total of less than 2,000 in donations. Care to guess which one is more likely to represent the public interest and which one is more likely to represent corporate interest?"

Some will buy that, because they want to, and others will object. That is the point, muddy the waters so to speak. That may well be the end of it.\n\nBut if it does linger, DeSantis will play the victim. Then as the consequences of this governments absolutely botched handling of this crisis continues to unfold, DeSantis and others will start finding new things to focus on. Given how close the election is, they will probably do it in rapid fire sequence until they latch onto something that sticks and goes viral. At which point they will focus all their attention on that and declare any hurricane related talk as a \"distraction\" while likely blaming the media. And Floridians will absolutely eat it up.\n\nRemember his \"handling\" of Disney. He declared war on the largest money maker in the state, got his clock repeatedly cleaned, continued to try and escalate matters, kept losing, sheepishly settled lawsuits, and then pivoted to another culture war subject. If I recall correctly that particular pivot was raging at California."

I'm more surprised they kept trying to spit into the literal wind for 20 years. In fairness though that does seem very on-brand for the wonder that is the US military lol.

These do not show that man could CONTROL a hurricane, control its path, or increase the severity of the hurricane, let alone the ability to create a hurricane.  Also, these were experiments were abandoned several decades ago because of controversy and how difficult it was to control the experiment and get clean data, and these studies have not been renewed since.\n\nI wish people would actually read the articles that people use as proof.  I spent a whole afternoon actually chasing the links to scientific articles on vaccines, and after that, I changed my mind because every conclusion drawn by the anti-vaccine articles were inaccurate and misrepresentative of the results the scientific papers presented."

However, city and congressional leaders said Monday that they believe the federal grants heading to Massachusetts with signed contracts are safe.\n\n\u201cThe contract has been finalized, so the money is secure,\u201d said Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat. \u201cThere may be some people in the next administration who think that binding contracts do not have to be honored. They are in for a rude awakening.\u201d\n\nWu, too, said she\u2019s confident. \u201cThis particular grant is already under contract, so legally, it cannot be revoked,\u201d she said.\n\nMassachusetts has been awarded more than $8.9 billion from spending packages passed under Biden, according to the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.\n\nIn Boston alone, the city has already been approved for approximately $100 million in grants for transportation, clean energy, and climate adaptation projects, city officials\u00a0[previously told the Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/01/science/environmental-justice-grants-trump-contracts/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link). Another $100 million is outstanding in applications for federal climate and transportation grants. Federal grants typically work through reimbursement: The local government pays for the work up front, then the federal government pays them back.\n\nWu said that she recently met with federal officials in D.C. about the status of Boston\u2019s federal climate grants and what might occur during the administration change.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing a review of all our grants that have been awarded,\u201d Wu said during the press conference Monday. \u201cWe have a small number \\[of grants\\] that we\u2019re still trying to make sure make it into contract form in the next couple of weeks.\u201d"

Bigger heaters are way more efficient than smaller ones, also having 4 outer walls per flat is stupid.\n\nWestern people eat way too much meat. E.g. all the 1.3 bio. Indian people together eat 80% of the meat, that 84 mio. Germans eat in a year. Beef is the worst food source - take a look at the land use statistics."

We can feed the current world with 1/4 the amount of land currently being used if we ate plants directly.

I am using figures from several intergovernmental and scientific sources. \n\nI can find numbers like 16.5% and 14% from academic sources. further, orgnizations like our world in data break that down and find things like while meat production is the highest single component at 31% of **food** emissions, its really not that far ahead of plants at 27%. That's also from a higher estimate at 26% to total emissions\n\nMy concern around that segment of the argument is that 1: its a distraction. and 2: that its ideological. \n\nVegan's keep making these arguments on rigid ideological grounds and don't care if they are wrong. that means that we lose the scientific high ground we need to be taken seriously. \n\nswitching to non fossil fuel power is already a massive challenge. having ideological intervention espousing picking up the 3rd or 5th biggest contribtuion with significant personal costs, low popularity and low effectiveness is a bad idea. \n\nCan you provide some of the sources you think support the idea its 87%? how would you compare them to the academic and data sources below? \n\nTwine, R.

So many people were unwilling to change when the risk of death from the virus could be measured in days.  Death from climate change is years away, or decades.  Or maybe even never, if you happen to be fortunate enough not to be in the crosshairs of an extreme weather event.\n\nThe people in the poor countries point the finger of blame at the wealthy countries.  People in the wealthy countries point the finger of blame at the billionaires.  \n\nAnd because you mentioned the US, after half of the country claimed poverty as the reason for voting for Trump, what did we do?  Set a new holiday spending record, inching ever closer to spending $1 trillion to celebrate a single day.  When the dust settles and the final numbers are published in January, I suspect we *will* exceed $1 trillion this year.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/holiday-spending-mastercard-0e11efb764f5ff0ad84ddb4505e17398](https://apnews.com/article/holiday-spending-mastercard-0e11efb764f5ff0ad84ddb4505e17398)\n\nIt doesn't matter if someone believes themselves responsible for the emissions, or if they blame the company which emitted the GHG on their behalf.  It's ultimately irrelevant because those purchases drove an additional $1 trillion of emissions that are going to be in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years.\n\nAnd we, as a country, consider this normal.  We consider it acceptable.  Even with the headlines talking more and more about climate change, our purchasing decisions say, \"So what?\"\n\nIs collapse inevitable?  At this late date, I think so.  The only thing that's not settled is how bad collapse is going to be, and by putting the pedal to the metal, we're ensuring that it's going to be as bad as possible, just as we did in 2020."

The key to avoiding it is to build a widespread understanding of where we need to go to be sustainable for the very long term.  Once enough of us understand that we are part of nature, have needs and drives shaped by evolution that must be met in appropriate ways and live on the only planet in the universe to which we are ideally suited, positive change will happen pretty quickly. \n\nThe trick is to get people to understand where we need to go.  I think the Aspen Proposal presents a pretty succinct description of the basic elements of that future, without slamming any current vested interests and with a long enough time frame to make many things possible that just aren't possible in the short term.

                "Content": "Spending = emissions.  I said that the other day to a climate scientist on social media, and he agreed.  Who you blame for the emissions -- the company that produces the product, or the person who buys the product -- is irrelevant.  Because of oil's role in the global economy (and fossil fuels in general), every time a person spends money on something, there are emissions associated with it.\n\nHere in America, where it's said that 70% of the country desires climate action (but 50% voted for Trump), this is what just happened.\n\n*Shoppers spent a record $10.8 billion online on Friday, over 10% more than they did last Black Friday, according to data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks retail transactions. That's more than double what consumers spent in 2017.*\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2024/12/01/g-s1-36310/black-friday-cyber-monday-record-spending](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/01/g-s1-36310/black-friday-cyber-monday-record-spending)\n\nThis, in a country that claimed it's too poor to even put food on the table reliably.  And there were emissions associated with every one of those 10.8 billion dollars.\n\nAnd we won't stop there.  Last year we spent close to $1 trillion to celebrate Christmas.  If the 10% growth in Black Friday sales is any indication, we'll easily blow right past a trillion dollars in spending, which means a trillion dollars worth of emissions.\n\n[https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-says-census-data-shows-2023-holiday-sales-grew-38-record-9644](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-says-census-data-shows-2023-holiday-sales-grew-38-record-9644)\n\nBy comparison, in 2022 only 16 other countries in the world had a *yearly* GDP that exceeded $1 trillion.\n\n[https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/)"

                "Content": "Correct. The suns light is being bounced off the increased carbon in the upper atmosphere and back to earth where they heat things up more then if they escaped  easily into space like before.\n\nEdit: \nA bit more detail if interested. \nThe suns light is composed of various wavelength of electromagnetic energy. It all enters the atmosphere and warms and illuminates our little human world. Some light gets absorbed by whatever it hits, including your body, and provides energy.  That energy can feel like warmth on a chilly day, or can cause skin cancer too, depending on its wavelength. (Recall that what we refer to as light, is only a small part of the electromagnetic scale which is delineated by wavelength)  Ironically, The shorter the wavelength, the more energy it has. The higher energy levels are UV light and those are the cause of skin cancer. The lower wavelengths are the ones which feel like heat.  (Very short wavelengths are called xrays)\nNow, a lot of the light of all wavelength is reflected back off the surfaces of the earth. Off the clouds, houses, oceans, and deserts. The shorter wavelengths of reflected light easily escape into the void of space and are lost. The longer wavelengths are the slightly less energetic infrared wavelengths. These are mostly what feel warm against your skin, and heat up your automobile in the car park. They are more easily reflected back to earth by clouds and water vapor, and various chemicals in the atmosphere such as methane and CO2. The amount of carbon present, and thus, how much infrared energy is reflected back to earth once it initially enters earths atmosphere,  is a main driver of the planets temperature. Too little, and the planet is a frigid iceball. Too much and it\u2019s a baking lifeless rock. (Much too much, and it\u2019s Venus) \nSo:  humans evolved at a time when the level of carbon in earths atmosphere allowed for mild conditions, some ice and cold areas, and some deserts, forests, and grasslands etc. Now we humans are drastically and very quickly adding more carbon to the atmosphere by burning oil coal and gas (all of these are forms of carbon long buried underground) The infrared light is being reflected back to the planets surface at a higher rate. Do you notice that the sun feels hotter on your skin? I first noticed this about ten years ago. That\u2019s the infrared hitting your skin, part of it is absorbed and heats your skin. Part is reflected off. That reflected part goes up and if it hits clouds or certain chemicals (CO2) it bounces off that and hits your skin again where more of it is absorbed as heat. (Light is like Tigger. It\u2019s bouncy!) you\u2019re getting a one-two punch. \nThis is the reason it\u2019s called the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d by some. The glass roof of a greenhouse does the same thing. Reflects more of the infrared back to the plants growing there. It\u2019s also how ovens work. The metal enclosure reflects the heat (heat is just infrared light) back onto the turkey cooking inside. Imagine trying to cook a turkey by just putting it beside an open fire. That would take way way longer. Reflected infrared is a very powerful force."

                "Content": "I strongly, *strongly* encourage everyone working in STEM-based fields to sign up for platforms like Blue Sky, start a YouTube channel, or find other outlets to share their work directly with the public. If we're walking into an era where \"alternative facts/science\" become the norm, it'll be more important than ever for actual experts to skip the middleman (and any censorship they might try to put up) and educate the public directly. This can do a whole number of things that might actually be a net benefit over how the information was once shared.\n\nThis option would also take advantage of the growing trends showing how the public is increasingly looking for direct and unfiltered news from knowledge *individuals*, especially as traditional news/media outlets decline. Just as independent journalists and experts have become legitamate sources of reliable information, scientists/researchers sharing their research directly would (hopefully) provide more accurate, transparent, unfiltered/unedited, and up-to-date scientific knowledge to the public. \n\nBut wait, it gets better!\n\n**Increased Trust and Transparency**: When scientists communicate directly with the public, it fosters greater trust and transparency. People can hear about discoveries and research straight from the source, reducing the risk of misinformation.\n\n**Counteracting Misinformation**: Directly addressing and debunking myths or false information, often in real-time, would help combat the spread of misinformation. Instead, scientists would be able to correct inaccuracies and provide evidence-based perspectives.\n\n**Building a Community**: Scientists can create communities of interest around their work, fostering collaboration and discussion. This can lead to new ideas, partnerships, and a more engaged and informed public.\n\n**Advocacy and Policy Influence**: This one especially would go a long way to help bring about real, long-term change. Basically, by raising awareness and educating the public on critical issues, scientista could influence public opinion and policy, equipping a knowledgeable public to advocate for science-based decisions and policies.\n\n**Feedback and Interaction**: Direct communication allows scientists to receive feedback and questions from the public, which can be valuable for refining their communication strategies and research approaches.\n\n**Accessibility and Inclusion**: By using various platforms, scientists can reach a broader and more diverse audience. This inclusivity ensures that more people have access to scientific knowledge and can benefit from it.\n\nI'm sure there are a hundred other benefits I'm not thinking of, but if we're going to effect change and create a better world for everyone who has to deal with the consequences of our own mistakes/stupidity, then we ought to encourage everyone who's able that there will always be an audience for truth."

It's a pretty circular system, using agricultural waste products like straw and seed hull, and turning it into gourmet mushrooms, packed with protein and nutrition.  We love to cook, and often cook toy mush, so we share out meals.  We started to aim for 20-30 meals per week, because we realized people need the help, seniors, young families, disabled etc.\n\nSome of the restaurants we serve found out and started donating what ever was left at the end of the night.  Our food recovery program has grown to between 1k-2k free meals a week.  About 20k meals this year that people may not have otherwise had, all saved from the landfill.  This all grew organically and as people heard, they came to help package, sort, deliver to shelters, community pantrys, encampments, needy families and the streets.\n\nSo when I look for good news, I see it on the faces of the people I feed.\n\nFind a way to get involved.  Change happens from the ground up, it begins inside each of us, and it's contagious.\n\nHope is better than fear, Love is better than hate, and Action is better than defeatism, no matter how bad the problem.  \n\nSo let's be hopeful, loving and take any small action we can.\n\nMushLove, Kind Stranger."

But those in countries without much of a fossil fuel industry have little incentive to keep using fossil fuels. Yes, their capitalist elites probably are invested in fossil fuels, and a few exceptional countries like the UK and Switzerland do a lot of the financing of fossil fuel projects. But outside of those exceptions, I think the biggest barriers are the external pressure from the US etc, some inertia and domestic public opinion and then the challenge of achieving GDP growth and rising corporate profits while shrinking emissions (aka green growth).\n\nI think it makes sense for the countries in the last category (which is the large majority by population and GDP) to abandon the petrostates and effectively sanction them for their actions."

The water moves along until there is a low spot.  It slowly fills each pothole and tank, until little waterfalls form and the water moves further along the stream bed.\n\nThe 1972 *Limits to Growth* was seminal work which remains controversial.  It didn't introduce the notion of ecological collapse due to perpetual growth, however. Many natural philosophers had already been writing about that. The novel contribution in LTG was the application of what was then the relatively new technology of computer-based modeling.  The principles have been around forever."

                "Content": "You're gaslighting.  I criticized the *label*, rather than the technology.  And you're ignoring the elephant in the room.  Even if Hermione Granger cast the *Instantaneous Ubiquitous Renewable Energious* spell over the entire earth (yay!) and we instantly had net zero and renewable energy everywhere......  we will *still* collapse nature - and therefore our civilization - because all of our institutions and all of our infrastucture and most of our cultural and national identity suffers from PEGA - *Perpetual Economic Growth Addiction*.  In the short term we can grow the economy without increasing human impact on nature by way of things like efficiency innovations, inventing ways to turn existing waste into products, improving the circular economy, expanding the service sector, etc. Those thingsare turnips, however. We can only squeeze so much blood - still *more* economic growth - out of these turnips. In the end, we must take more resources from nature and/or increase the demand on the shrinking overall supply of \"ecosystem services\". \n\nWhat does that mean?  Well, by way of analogy here are familiar examples:\n\n1. Take an empty balloon.  Its capacity represents Nature's \"carrying capacity\" (for us) noting that we live on a finite planet.\n2. Now keep blowing air into the balloon, to represent our determination to perpetually grow the economy.  Over the long term, constant economic growth means a constant increase in our impact on Nature.  Don't stop blowing air into the balloon. What eventually happens to Nature's carrying capacity (for us)?\n\nAnother illustration\n\n3. Pretend you have a nice juicy trust fund.\n\n4. Now imagine you are reckless and spend more than the dividends, so you make up the difference by withdrawing a little of the principal.\n\n5. Next year dividends are slightly lower due to the smaller principal.  But your partying ways have grown over the year before so your bills are higher.  So you take out a little *more* of the principal.   What eventually happens?\n\nThese principals are applied to each calendar year, to estimate the date at which our global impact on nature equals Nature's regeneration over the *entire* year.  That date is called \"Overshoot Day\".   Because the global economy suffers from PEGA - Perpetual Economic Growth Addiction - like the diminishing Trust Fund, Overshoot Day takes place a little earlier each year.  [https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/about-earth-overshoot-day/](https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/about-earth-overshoot-day/)\n\nSo I think solar and wind and all is great and is necessary.  I'm likely to rebuild my own rotting roof to improve its ability take solar panels.   But it's not accurate to call it \"clean\" energy.   It's only \"*cleaner\",* and the things I've already mentioned are externalized, rather than factored into the price. Does that mean renewables suck and should be banned?  Of course not.  It just means we got into this bottomless ecological crisis pit by lying to ourselves.  If we hope to climb out, its time to be honest and realistic.\n\n*If you want to debate more, don't put words you make up in my mouth, please.*"

                "Content": "> To varying degrees, both Europe and the US have failed to grasp the decarbonisation challenge identified by their own scientists decades ago. Insofar as there is to be a global climate leader it can now only be China, which is responsible for more than 30 per cent of global emissions and has mastered the green energy supply chain. Given mounting tension with the US, Beijing has every incentive to minimise oil imports. The key question is whether the Chinese Communist party can muster the political will to override its fossil fuel interests. If it can, it will not single-handedly solve the climate crisis but it will assert a claim to leadership that the west will find hard to answer."

                "Content": "The real difference between animals vs fossil fuels is the source of the carbon. For animal CO2e, is it coming from carbon already in the short-term carbon cycle or the long-term cycle?\n\n\nAll fossil fuel carbon use is part of the long-term carbon cycle.\u00a0This point is missed by so many people. Chopping a tree down and burning it is a completely different act compared with digging coal out of the ground and burning it. The first act is not going to increase the amount of carbon in the short-term cycle anywhere like what fossil fuel use is.\n\n\nAnimal carbon is a complex use of fossil fuels (transport, fertilisers and pesticides) and short-term carbon (land clearance and direct carbon from the animal). Fossil fuels are simply straight-up far, far worse than any discussion of agriculture because they're fundamental to modern agriculture.\n\n\nBy focusing directly on fossil fuels, you short-circuit the discussion and take it back to the source of the real threat."

Roughly 40% of our land usage is devoted solely to agriculture - and not the good kind. Corn is then made largely into fuel or poor foods, soy largely into feedstock for meat production. Industrial farming both displaces native ecosystems, land that could be used for renewable energy or restored, and causes large-scale runoff that poisons our waterways. It\u2019s pretty incredible."

Even things like rare earth minerals will have to be obtained from the sea and needed for things like nuclear reactors.\n\nMeanwhile, the ones making and selling components are for-profit corporations, which means they need to sell more of them each time for more profits. the same goes for much of the global economy.\n\nFinally, workers and the public in general want higher pay, better work conditions, and more things to buy, including not only basic needs but even wants.\n\nWhat all of those mean is that any transition will involve a combination of using fossil fuels plus dealing with diminishing returns."

I imagine about 2% of the budget goes to fossil fuel related work, like funding the Energy Information Agency's industry reports.\n\nThis doofus is going to be a fifth wheel.

For example, the elected party may alter or fail to enact their platform, the proposed policies may not have the estimated impact, or other factors may influence emissions and negate, inflate, or obscure the impact of the policies.\n\n>Note that in the case of the United States in 2020, we did not attempt an analysis because of differences in the political systems that create large uncertainties concerning the Biden administration's ability to pass climate legislation.\n\nI think that voting for climate-forward policies and candidates is the absolute *mininum* we can do as individuals. I worry that some may see this paper as justification for living a high-consumption, high-emissions lifestyle, as if that could all be canceled out by casting a vote every couple years."

                "Content": "You used one anecdote? The CAA? In 50 years, voting got you one anecdote. \n\nThe Montreal Protocol was not a law passed by politicians in the way you think it was. It was also not voted for by anybody. What you don't realize is the United Nations doesn't have any sovereign right to pass law into domestic statute of any member state. It's a negotiation shop. The member states will debate around a table come on each pulling a little bit from the other and deciding where they fit in the wider context, and most of that work is actually done by diplomats not by the electric representatives\n\nMontreal was a commitment created through negotiation by diplomats (unelected) but equally the policy that was actually enacted in each country was a different thing. Because domestic statute was different and countries were split into different articles by their contribution to the problem and the capability for solution. After that, each country then had to implement that into their own statute. It wasn't their politicians that they did that. It was their civil service. Montreal protocol did not in itself enact anything that any person voted for. I don't mean that in the context of it's not being a good thing I mean that in the context of the diplomatic effort without it ever having been a topic on a manifesto somewhere.\n\nPeople didn't vote for it. Some didn't care for it.\n\nAnd let's suppose those two single things somehow proved your point. They are 37 years apart. So are you calling a once in 37 year event come on when we have less than seven to make the next change, a success? Are you out of your mind?\n\nPoliticians are first class trash. Which one of the two badonkadonks that you have in the USA do you think is actively going to be successful in reversing climate change? Biden has been responsible for facilitating some 10 million tons of cementorable in Gaza. Do you realize the emissions footprint of cement? 622 tonnes for every turn off cement made. So Biden has helped create 6.2 billion tons of CO2.\n\nIt's rubbish! They just want to make you believe it's true full stop and that is the only measure of success of politics. It doesn't require manifesting and actual solution anywhere. Because politics only exist because of incompetence somewhere in any system. You are either managing it or hiding it"

                "Content": "Sadly, this is by far the biggest misinformation in the climate movement. It doesn't make a difference. Because it doesn't create the large scale systemic change you think it does. \n\nFor example, you can vote Democrats or even Stein  but if the Senate is full of Republicans it's going nowhere. Add to that, that government has a set of laws enacted to protect public money but those laws are implemented in probably the most incompetent way and the elected reps themselves are not responsible for the civil service protocol and you suddenly start to realize that the act of voting itself is probably the most pointless thing anybody ever does for climate change. There are other reasons to do it, but climate change isn't one of them.\n\n* Waste nothing\n* Power using renewables\n* Hybrid your food between purchases and grow your own\n* Use active travel anywhere you can\n* Eat plant-based diets\n* Only buy for obtain second hand clothes and everything else\n* Find a job which allows you to work remote\n* if you are responsible for buying anything in your employers business, buy sustainable only and change of the human process to have at least 60% of your questions influenced by sustainability criteria\n\nThese are CERTAIN to reduce your contribution to the planet, and as long as everyone does that, we're getting there quickly. Indeed, in the UK, near 10% of the population voted for the Green Party. If they do this alone, given where in the social start of those people are, we would reduce the UK's emissions by 15% single-handedly. \n\nBy voting for the Green Party, they have succeeded in achieving exactly 0% reduction in ecological footprint. Because the Green Party didn't win the election, and have less than 1% of the seats in Parliament from that 10% of the vote. Even under a proportion representation system, they would still have only 10% of the seats in Parliament to come up which isn't enough to influence policy. \n\nInstead, those 5 million people could reduce their footprint using the methods above come on and that is the same as large scale systemic change for the whole population.\n\nThe idea that voting itself makes change is the biggest, first-class BS anywhere that anybody has ever said! Under no circumstances will politicians of any stripe be able to do anything. People have done that for 50 years and we're finished because of it. \n\nWrong answer."

Here's a handy calculator.\n\n[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i)\n\nI'll do some of the work, looking at someone who's single and childless in the US.

It's not all that difficult to be considered wealthy when abject poverty is the global norm.\n\nI can't post the screenshot because this sub doesn't allow the posting of pics, but a couple weeks ago a climate scientist posted a perspective on how our lifestyles are so disproportionately high-emitting compared to those 4 billion people -- the average American energy-efficient refrigerator, running for a year, generates more emissions than the yearly emissions for any one of those 4 billion people."

Here in America (and, of course, other wealthy countries), we immediately think of billionaires, or multimillionaire athletes/entertainers. But no, it's not that.\n\n*If you earn $60,000 a year after tax and you don\u2019t have kids, you\u2019re in the richest 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.*\n\n*If you have a household income of $130,000 after tax and you\u2019ve got a partner and one kid, you\u2019re also in the richest 1 percent.*\n\n*Or say you have a household income of $160,000 after tax and you\u2019ve got a partner and two kids.

If you own a house in a nice Auckland suburb without a mortgage, you might even crack the top 1%.*\n\nOwn a home, you're almost certainly in the top 10%. Start saving for retirement in your 20s, and you'll almost certainly be a millionaire by the time you retire, and probably even by the time you're in your 40s or 50s. \n\nAnd why does it take so little money to fall into the top 1%/10%?

Much of the study concerns the obscene emissions of the world's richest 50 people, the megayacht-owning, private-jetting elite whose emissions together exceed those of all the poorest 100 million."

Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\nIf you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:\n\n* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.

                "Content": "Relevant paper (emphasis mine):\n\nThe 2024 state of the climate report: Perilous times on planet Earth \n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biae087/7808595\n\n>A 2024 opinion poll has unveiled the predictions of hundreds of prominent climate scientists of the IPCC, senior authors, and review editors (380 respondents). From a personal perspective, nearly 80% of these scientists anticipate global temperatures increasing by at least 2.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century (Carrington 2024). Nearly half of them foresee a rise of at least 3\u00b0C. A mere 6% believe that the internationally agreed-on limit of 1.5\u00b0C will be achieved (figure\u00a05d). This parallels an earlier survey of IPCC scientists, which showed that approximately 60% expected warming of at least 3\u00b0C (Tollefson 2021). These projections paint a bleak picture of the future, with many scientists envisioning widespread famines, conflicts, mass migration, and increasing extreme weather that will surpass anything witnessed thus far, posing catastrophic consequences for both humanity and the biosphere (Carrington 2024).\n\n>Rapidly phasing down fossil fuel use should be a top priority. This might be accomplished partly through a *sufficiently high global carbon price* that could restrain emissions by the wealthy while potentially providing funding for much-needed climate mitigation and adaptation programs. In addition, *pricing and reducing methane emissions* is critical for effectively mitigating climate change. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and unlike carbon dioxide, which persists in the atmosphere for centuries, methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime, making reductions impactful in the short term (Shindell et al. 2024). Drastically cutting methane emissions can slow the near-term rate of global warming, helping to avoid tipping points and extreme climate impacts.\n\n>In a world with finite resources, *unlimited growth is a perilous illusion*. We need bold, transformative change: *drastically reducing overconsumption and waste, especially by the affluent, stabilizing and gradually reducing the human population through empowering education and rights for girls and women, reforming food production systems to support more plant-based eating, and adopting an ecological and post-growth economics framework that ensures social justice* (Table S4). Climate change instruction should be *integrated into secondary and higher education core curriculums worldwide* to raise awareness, improve climate literacy, and empower learners to take action. We also need more immediate efforts to *protect, restore, or rewild ecosystems*."

The entire country is aligned and pushing towards a cleaner future and cleaner air.\n\nThey had the economy, leadership, and will to see where things were going and enact an effective trajectory to solve the problem. \n\nThe air still isn't great there, but the efforts are still vastly greater than anywhere else I've seen in the world, so if they can turn that around, they will take the crown for sustainability."

To try to cross that bridge: imagine that there is a community of 10,000 humans. Within that community, 100 of them (which view themselves as more important than the rest) are killing hundreds and hundreds of other innocent humans. Now imagine that 1 of those 100 humans sees what is going on, thinks that her/his group killing hundreds, and eventually thousands, of other humans is egregious and immoral. So, s/he wishes that those 100 people would be eliminated, for the sake of the thousands that would be spared. \n\nDo you believe that person is \u201cdeplorable and deserving of elimination?\u201d I\u2019d hope not. It\u2019s the same fundamental reason we lock up murderers: if somebody is taking other people\u2019s lives, then they are inhibited from doing so. \n\nIn this case, our whole species is wiping out thousands of entire species every year. Our 8 billion are killing trillions, and I believe that our species is not any more important or deserving of life than another species. I\u2019ve never seen any logical reason why any human quality makes humans more deserving of life than non-humans."

                "Content": "There's a lot of knee jerk reaction to AI, especially in leftist spaces, that leads to people basing their opinions of it on how annoying tech and investor bros are rather than looking at it objectively. I'm assuming a lot of these people are somewhat familiar with TRPF in Volume III of Das Kapital too, which makes their failure to engage with new developments all the more frustrating since there's a massive opportunity there to radicalize people.\n\nI have some formal background in ML and went into the weeds on recent advances many times (it's related to my work), and while I think \"AGI\" is a buzzword in the way that it's being thrown around, I still think the potential for current AI is massive, especially once all the compute that's already funded is built out. So massive that I lose sleep at night over it because I don't trust any of these people with it, and if I had a magic wand I would freeze AI development in place globally for a decade while we decided what to do with it.\n\nEven if it hits a wall in the next few years with the CoT and synthetic data techniques not panning out (for sake of argument), it's still a massive double edged sword that will radically change the economy, upend the job market and accelerate the trend of technological unemployment and displacement that has been happening for decades now. It will put so much downward pressure on wages and displace people so frequently that it may drive the systemic rate of unemployment up in a way that previous waves of automation didn't, which could break capitalism as we know it.\n\nI really wish leftists took it seriously instead of downplaying it or insisting we put it back in the box (impossible given that it's deeply tied into NatSec and the new Cold War). It doesn't have to be AGI to radically reshape the economy or create fertile ground for revolution. It doesn't have to be sentient either. Most of the work we do doesn't rely on uniquely human insights that can only be replaced by a being with faculties that resemble a human, in many cases AI will either be better than us at narrow tasks or it will be good enough in relation to how much it costs.\n\nI hope you're right about AI being able to synthesize all the academic papers and figure out fusion energy or something because we're locked into this path, like you said."

From the documents presented in the *Heated* article, and lots more elsewhere, it is obvious that the fossils knew how bad it could get, and how soon. That makes their crime as bad as anything Hitler, Stalin, Putin, or Pol Pot ever dreamed of. Beyond consigning all of the upper level management of the fossils, anyone who was part of the deception, and their stooges like Willy Soon, to hard labor for the rest of their lives, we should confiscate their assets, and any family wealth derived from fossil fuels, as well as the fossil corporations, and invest whatever we can make scrapping those industries into fighting back this exponentially worsening disaster. And we should try to do it before the already begun, exponentially growing methane burp takes it entirely out of our hands.\n\nYou know what the worst of it is? A few years ago we were giving the fossils $645 billion in subsidies to pour gasoline on the fire. This year, says Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, it's $700 b. Joe Biden wanted to pretend to do something about climate change while selling more gas, oil and coal than any other country on the planet.

                "Content": "I don't doubt that despair over the climate crisis contributes to suicidality in some.\n\nI've been climate aware for 35 years, and have read \\~20 peer-reviewed articles each year for since the mid 1990s. It's a contributing reason for why I've chosen to never have children (though SSRI induced asexuality is primary). I'm here, now, mainly because there's so many books and films I want to encounter before my end.\n\nOne doesn't have to read scare stories for the climate crisis to contribute to despair. One can go straight to the peer-reviewed literature. Lots is bowdlerized, painting a picture of society working together to limit temps to +3 \u00b0C (< 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C was always fanciful). But there's also a body of evidence, from paleoclimatology to modern \"hot models\" that point to a +5 or +6 \u00b0C 22nd century. That's a world that can only support a small fraction of the current population, and the transition from 8 billion to that is one of wet bulb events, crop-failures, famines, civil collapse, disease and violence.  Cloud feedback studies pointing to still worse outcomes, as in geologic extinction events. I didn't subject anyone else to live through that, and some may chose not to live through it. \n\nIts irrational only to those who choose willful ignorance. For those who are immersed, we feel empathy. The main thing we can do for young people is to encourage them in climate political activism, and offer them a more science based appreciation of the **rate** changes will happen. Sea level rise is very slow, it'll be less than a meter this century, less than 3 by 2200. Wet-bulb events are an issue localized for those alive today to South Asia and Persian Gulf states. The fast effects for most people living today are mainly crop failures and much higher food costs. Disastrous for poorer countries, shifting spending patterns for wealthy ones. It's pretty easy to shift to diets lower on the trophic ladder, which has largely insulated me from food price inflation for 15 years, and has reduced my climate impact (though not nearly so much as being childfree)."

This isn't about science, this is failure of societies to recognize the threats and adjust accordingly.  I'm not depressed because of the climate news, I'm depressed because most people still clamor for more \"Business As Usual\" and have a desire to win the rat race, even the ones in the richest parts of the world."

We\u2019re kind of a horrible species.\n\nYeah, that's pretty much the way I look at it, too.\n\nWe have 10,000-12,000 years of human society in the rearview mirror, if we just measure from the beginning of agriculture, when humans began transitioning from a hunter/gatherer lifestyle and settled down in one place.  And after all these years, we can't even get humanity to agree that every single person deserves the same basic rights, let alone ascribing any rights to the non-human natural world.\n\nAnd we're going to cooperate at a level in which we've never cooperated before?  To coordinate 8+ billion people across 195 countries to all do their part to combat our environmental issues, of which climate change is only a portion?\n\nPlease.  We're going to keep blaming the institutions created by humans instead of just blaming humans.  We'll blame the governments we elect, in the countries with some semblance of free elections.  We'll blame the corporations which sell us the things we're unwilling to do without, or unwilling to use less of.\n\nAnd in the end, we probably won't go extinct, but the technological civilization we've all come to know and love -- because most do love it, whether they'd admit it or not -- will almost certainly go extinct."

After Reagan, Schultz, and Kissinger got done, oil production worldwide rose to a new peak in production, with the US Dollar being the standard of sale until these days. But to undo the vast majority of damage, it is best to start in the 1960s. There is usually a lull between laws and loopholes, the 1960s was the start Reagan and Nixon in politics.

When you have that much money, it seems to turn into a chore of making more and more money at any cost. This inherent greed and selfishness overrules any sense of empathy or reason, it's essentially an irrational motivation to live by. They don't seem to think about anything other than increasing their wealth because their entire life revolves around making money, that seems to be the only thing that matters enough to justify their existence. It gives them more power and that's something they want to gain more of at any cost. They also tend to be the same kind of people who think they won't live long enough to see the consequences of their actions or that their wealth will save them when civilization collapses."

I suppose it's an attempt not to seem \"doomerist,\" given people tend to just shut off at that point -- but, frankly, all of the accurate data and real expectations we can make frankly WOULD render a normal person to shut off, that's just how damning and catastrophic the actual data is when compared to historical standards of how we take data into account in public policy (literally not at all in any meaningful way, if anything quite the opposite with industry just using such data as an indicator of the fruitlessness of pursuing systemic change and instead justifying further hydrocarbon extraction in a zero-sum profit maximization game).\u00a0\n\n>I appreciate that PBS wants to provide educational material in the typical vein of educational material, which is to be pseudo-inspiration porn, but it's frankly deeply depressing how mind-numbingly optimistic PBS in their typical coverage of this stuff. It's not there are really any even remotely positive signs of change anytime soon: all of the signs indicate the opposite, that we've already well and truly failed to prevent climate change, and everybody is not only essentially entirely over it, at this point, but industry and government are actively giving up on previous climate change policy and prioritizing \"energy security\" and other neoliberal nonsense.\n\n>I'd really prefer if scientists said the truth: we've already f---ed up and failed as far as prevention within preexisting contemporary systems will allow, and we must begin pursuing deeply radical solutions up to and including the outright end of capitalism itself, if we want to have any hope of preventing hundreds of millions of climate refugees from being extant at any given time for the remainder of human history as a direct consequence of entire countries and subnational jurisdictions being swallowed up by boiling, perpetually-hurricane prone waters."

                "Content": "Kudos to OP.  Rewriting the Constitution is the end game.  We\u2019ve been talking about this for years on r/KochWatch but the story hasn\u2019t gotten any traction.  There\u2019s a much larger overview that ties this into what multiple different groups are trying to achieve.  The conservative takeover of the Supreme Court was only the first step.\n\nOne of the major missing pieces of the puzzle that virtually nobody has connected is the money flowing from Silicon Valley.  These so-called \"tescrealists\" (you can look that up if you don\u2019t know what it is), are perfectly fine with human extinction if it means that 1% of the population will survive to achieve AGI and reach a posthuman stage of technological advancement.\n\nThe connection here is that the \"dark\" tescrealists also want to rewrite the Constitution.   If you read Hacker News at all and follow the billionaires behind these groups, who are mostly venture capitalists, it turns out that they also hate the way the Constitution is written.  One major faction tends to fund extreme and radical right wing groups because they believe it will eventually result in less regulation for tech companies, and allow them to create a new kind of AI or technology that makes democratic governments obsolete and out of date.  They actually say this and believe this.  \n\nWhen Elon Musk promotes \"Dark MAGA\", he is actually referring to this idea, which is based on a number of far right philosophers who are aligned with big tech and the tescrealists, believing that democracy needs to be destroyed and replaced with authoritarianism for technology to progress to the next stage.  I\u2019m not making this up.  \n\nYou may be asking, so what is the crossover between the petrochemical industry and the tech world? As it turns out, the petrochemical industry, like fintech, has historically been the first adopters of major tech advances.  While Silicon Valley was originally motivated by WWII spending, and the public received the benefits of that research in the form of commercial products, the petrochemical industry was always at the leading edge, since energy drives every sector.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s newest tech requires the most energy.  Everything from data centers to AI.  Libertarians blame the left and environmentalists for not embracing nuclear power, but much of that opposition was financed in secret by the oil industry to protect their market share.  So we have a very close working relationship, although it might not be obvious, between the energy industry and tech.  And when they want to, the oil industry can interfere with the supply of energy to move markets.  The Kochs did this decades ago during the California energy crisis."

There\u2019s an effect from solar cycles, but not a large one. \n\nI noticed on your profile you mentioned the Carrington event. You\u2019ll notice that the Carrington event didn\u2019t have much of a long term climate impact. Another such storm would be catastrophic, but only because of its effects on technology, not on the Earth itself. Climate change and mass extinctions have happened in the past due to changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which is exactly what is happening right now. The main difference this time is humans are the source.\n\nI also don\u2019t get how the current narrative could be about money. There is way more money in protecting fossil fuels than displacing them."

While the Trump administration will undoubtedly do its best to throw a wrecking ball into climate action, the clean energy momentum created by President Biden, being actioned across the country, is likely to continue at significant scale,\u201d said Bill Hare, Climate Analytics CEO, in the press release. \u201cThe key issue is whether countries stick together and continue to move forward with action, a Trump rollback of US policies, as damaging as it is, can be overcome.\u201d\n\nCAT said putting the planet on track for a downward trajectory of emissions begins with the greatest emitters.\n\nIn conjunction with its report, CAT released its recommended targets for 2035 for seven of the planet\u2019s biggest emitters: the U.S., China, India, Australia, the European Union, Japan and Indonesia, as well as Troika countries Azerbaijan, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates."

                "Content": "Because single-use plastic is produced from fossil fuels, extracting and creating these plastics emits vast amounts of greenhouse gases.  \n  \nIt is estimated that just the extraction of these fossil fuels and their transportation to plastic factories emits 1.5 to 12.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. \n  \nRemoving forested land for oil extraction and pipeline construction has also released more than 1.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This land clearing also limits the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. \n  \nThe refinement of plastics emits an additional 184 to 213 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year.  \n  \nLandfills, where single-use plastics are sent, account for more than 15% of methane emissions. The disposal of more plastics in landfills leads to increases in landfill size and these emissions. \n  \nThere is an enormous floating mass of plastic in the Pacific Ocean, twice the size of Texas, that continues to grow. \n  \nPlastic pollution affects the most vulnerable communities first. Developed countries, such as the United States, send plastic to developing countries for processing. Eventually, the amount of plastic can become so overwhelming that these communities run out of ways to dispose of it and become covered in plastic trash.   \n   \nColorado.edu: [The impact of plastic on climate change](https://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2023/12/15/impact-plastic-climate-change)"

I'm in a similar research space and there's lots of steps missing from the pipeline of the lifetime of plastics in their paper. For example incineration, export for incineration etc and that releases a ridiculous amount of emissions that are unaccounted for in Colorado's research. Also their research I would argue as analytically weak. They didn't do the work to estimate the unknowns in the system, but quantified them as zero. They have likely under reported emissions by a factor of anywhere between 3 and 10."

                "Content": "It's single handedly the single barrier to both social value AND climate changesm mitigation and adaptation.\n\nIn the UK, which is the market I know best, there isn't really any private sector money. We don't export anything to get any, so every business ultimately has a public sector client somewhere in its downstream supply chain. \n\nAll construction work is underpinned by Government bonds (it's akin to a legal requirement to take out a bond to secure any other debts - that includes insurance and banking, who then ripple that through the chain from central bank to investment bank to retail bank to your mortgage). All of the money that's been created is circulated out of the public sector, into the private sector and the profit, taken out of the private sector via the open market. This can be anywhere including pensions, or international investors.\n\nTax brings money back in, but only a limited amount of it and mostly from workers. It's the only way to bring it in given the UK doesn't run that many state enterprises or get the money coming back through shareholding.\n\nAnyway, the point of this is public money is siphoned out through the rest of the system. Public procurement is the method by which that happens. 100% of all public-to-private revenue transfers occurs through public procurement and commissioning.\n\nFurthermore, 70% to 94.3% of the emissions and biodiversity footprint of the public sector and includes it's energy (scope 2) and all the business at all levels they give money to in its supply chain (scope 3). If public procurement don't adequately qualify the suppliers, then public money is used to destroy the planet. Period! \n\nSo when a public body makes a legal commitment and enacts it, like SBTi, it mandates that the legislative and public body commits every aspect of their operations to science based decision making, target setting, operations and buying models.\n\nBut 100% of them don't.\n\nMany public authorities signed it not realising the ramifications. It means that their operational, vendor and purchasing management departments instantly became incapable (incompetent and unable to do the job). It means they need to be scientists. Most of the can't tie their own shoes without help. They mostly make excuses about it having to meet some legislation they only have a passing knowledge of. They are usually glorified admin and even those who have a business degree forgot it a long time ago. \n\nThe only fast enough solution is to fire them all and replace them. However, there's no money. Because it all funnelled out through the private sector and 30% of it, abroad. \n\nThe public sector is a market distorting force in most advanced economies and this magnifies this issue."

It was a major factor in recent climatic events such as the marine heatwave crisis around the British Isles. The very sudden increase of solar radiative inputs in NW Europe have also been suggested as a factor in recent heatwave trends, but at the same time can be attributed to the relatively cooler summer conditions of 2024 due to how the atmosphere interacts with well above average sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.\n\nOverall it provides an interesting analog to demonstrate what factors influence the climatology in NW Europe and provides a good example that changes in solar inputs can effectively override theoretical thermohaline circulative influences."

                "Content": "Most cruise ships have scrubbers on some of the engines. \n\nGenerally what happens is when the ship enters into emission control zones, like along the US coast or Alaska, they use the scrubbers and burn MDO(diesel). Once they\u2019re 20nm away from shore or in places like Mexico where environmental requirements are lax the scrubbers are by-passed or the engines with scrubbers are placed on backup and the remaining engines burn HFO. \n\nIf the ship is making way at sea, or is moored and tied into shore power air quality on deck is fine. HOWEVER, if you find yourself on a cruise ship while it\u2019s anchored in a country like Mexico, try to limit your time on deck, better yet, go on shore and enjoy your vacation."

If Trump is re-elected, it is a nightmare in so many ways that I cannot count them and that includes the biggest emitter on the planet doing everything it can to make matters worse. The environment has been me top priority with me for over 50 years. It saddens me that no one else in my family or that I even know has this priority but I don't believe that the 14% dropping to 8% is in any way meaningful. Most people cannot see the danger. We have always had droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. so it is easy to be the frog in lukewarm water that will eventually come to a boil and to not know or care. The governments and scientists do know though and that is why voting matters. The USA military has said it is the most dangerous thing there is to our national security."

First we have to **depoliticize** the truth of Climate Change. Let's talk about climate and nothing else. No Palestinians, no Trans rights, no Indigenous reparations... It is not that those are not great causes well deserving of our attention but the fact is that mixing issues results in a **muddied message that confuses people**.\n\nSecond we need to stop thinking that \"Saint Greta\" is going to **perform a miracle** any second now... Greta is not a unifying savior, she is gritty, she tell it like it is and is not afraid of insulting anyone... That would be nice if she was an Army General but those are not the qualities that unify people. We would be much better served by someone with the attitude of a Pete Buttigieg or a Amy Klobuchar... Greta was great for a while but now she has become a ball and chain that slows down the movement.\n\nThird, we need to run the fight for climate change exactly like we run a **marketing campaign**, this means not insulting people who do not subscribe to our point of view and to slowly bring them to see things our way by having meaningful conversations and solid facts. We do not want to scare away people, we want them to join us! \n\nFourth, we have to realize that our ennemies are NOT the people themselves, no matter if they are Trump voters or against Trans rights, The enemy is the oil & Gas corporations who brainwashed those people. Somehow we need to find a way to sever that hold the oil & gas have on the people and part of that is to show the vast economic benefits of going green and how it will improve their lives."

So I\u2019m going to live it up while I can.  If that makes me selfish, so be it, but am I any more selfish than all the idiots who voted for Trump because they thing he\u2019ll make eggs cheaper?"

What we\u2019re seeing here is the dying desperate attempts of patriarchal capitalism/colonialism trying to hold onto its power and they are pulling every dirty trick in the book.  People will only go along with it for so long though, as they realize they don\u2019t actually benefit from it in the end.  \n\nI also believe that there is zero point in giving up hope, even if we cross certain climate thresholds hope still exists because it\u2019s about mitigating the damage at that point.  I have two daughters and I think about them a lot and their future, I am simply trying to raise them as strong, caring people; one of are huge deficits as a Western society is our lack of empathy and compassion for those around us, a direct result of decades of unbridled consumerism and keeping-up-with-the-Joneses.  \n\nI realize that most in this sub probably don\u2019t share my mentality, this can be a pretty grim place, that is their right but the honest answer is we don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s going to happen."

While we can do all in our power to fight that, it's looking fairly unescapable. We are having to process grief for disasters that have not yet come to pass. Grief for that tiny, tiny window of times where a fraction of the human population got to live absolutely decadently on the back of everyone else (see the concept of energy slave >> https://jancovici.com/en/energy-transition/energy-and-us/how-much-of-a-slave-master-am-i/ or the How many Earths concept >> https://overshoot.footprintnetwork.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/ ).\n\n\nSo the one hopeful thing I can say, is that in the global chaos and disruption that is fast oncoming, we will probably get the opportunity to actually transform our societies away from capitalism, insane inequality and growth, if not at global scale, at least in some places/regions. Because when the current system continues crashing headfirst into concrete wall after concrete wall, people finally *will* have to look for alternatives, because they won't have a choice. The only at-scale example we have of what could happen then is Cuba when it was almost completely cut off from oil, lemme tell you farming's gonna be back in fashion real fast.\n\n\nSo, I think you could help build a happy life for your kid by participating in these kind of transition where you live now already! Reconnecting with your socio-ecological system, aka all the living beings around you :)"

It might not be that comforting, but liberal democracies were/are anyway not doing nearly enough to prevent catastrophic consequences, as there are too many interests behind fossil fuels, and while Trump makes it worse, it is also an alarming bell for everyone who would just not worry too much about it (foreigns governments included).\n\nFor what I know, we are on track to make a good portion of the planet un-habitable by the end of the century, and while extreme weather events will be more and more frequent and dangerous, the one and biggest problem that will determine if human civilization ends or not is food production under extreme climate: that is, will we be able to make agriculture work? With the collapse of the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the acidification of oceans, the food chain will be at risk, which will make societies unstable and increase the risk of war.\n\nHowever the northern parts of the planet are not going to be an uninhabitable wasteland, and we could get away with just the southern and poorer parts of the world to really suffer, but if the socio-economic system doesn't change then having a very hard second-half of life for present children is almost assured. \n\nThat being said, not having children doesn't solve this problem, as aging population is another collapse worthy factor (look at Japan/Korea), but humans needs to be on their wit's end to actually be able to make drastic changes, as history proves..."

China technology will be years ahead and the US will never catch up."

He was a junior level counsel for a couple of years in the private sector. He worked for a VC for a couple of years. He more or less quit working as a senator after a year and a half to run for VP. In the 118th Congress, Vance sponsored 36 bills. The median sponsorships per senator was 54. Vance co-sponsored 272, compared to a median of 362.\n\nDigging deeper, the bills he sponsored are drivel. Aside from the customary and common but pointless resolutions to recognize or comment on something, Vance's legislative record is mostly for show to.make statements against diversity policies. His legislative record is a joke.\n\nVance has never been in charge of anything.\n\nIf Trump doesn't live to the end of this term, Vance will be, by a wide margin, the least qualified person to be president in well over a century, probably *ever*. Ffs Gerald Ford had more experience."

Nearly all of them were completely new to the modern world. The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology.\u00a0\n\nThe study follows another published last year in which researchers found 33 viruses in 15,000-year-old ice they dug out of a Tibetan glacier. 28 of them were previously unknown to science.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau is called the \u201cwater tower of Asia\u201d because it feeds some of the world\u2019s longest rivers, including China\u2019s Yellow River and India\u2019s Ganges. Scientists worry that climate-change-propelled ice melt might release deadly\u00a0pathogens\u00a0into them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIce-entrapped modern and ancient pathogenic microbes could lead to local epidemics and even pandemics,\u201d the study\u2019s authors stated. \u201cThe release of potentially\u00a0hazardous\u00a0bacteria could affect the two most populated countries in the world: China and India.\u201d \u00a0\u201d"

That\u2019s important because above a certain temperature you\u2019ll just die. That\u2019s the difference between \u201cdry heat\u201d and high humidity heat, like in Florida. 105 degrees in Arizona IS NOT going to feel the same as 105 degrees in south Florida\u2019s high humidity. \nNormally all this isn\u2019t that important. You feel hot you turn on the AC right? Of course. Dont be stupid. Until there\u2019s no power. Like after a bad storm, or some other event. Or like, a particularly hot week and then the power grid can\u2019t cope with everyone running all their AC units full blast. Or you know, maybe they just turn it off to cull the herd."

Trump\u2019s hope is that our brains will be so turned to mush, and our souls so beaten into despair that when he gets around to what he really intends to do there won\u2019t be any pushback.\n\nWhen he says outrageous things - like this - it\u2019s just his pusillanimous soul choosing to wage psychological warfare against the American people, just so he can slip in his real agenda because he knows he wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with those things if the people were not already politically exhausted. \n\nIn essence, he is immunizing his incoming administration against democracy, by way of a firestorm of propaganda"

Your argument that China didn\u2019t reduce their permits \u201cbecause they were literally the highest everywhere\u201d makes literally no sense. 83% of 1000 is 830, 83% of 100 is 83, 830>83.

This is why they\u2019re called resistive heaters. Heat pumps are different, they work exactly like a refrigerator, using electricity to move heat from one place to another. How they achieve this is interesting, but not necessary to understand how they achieve >100% efficiency. \n\n\u201cEfficiency\u201d here means something slightly different than usual. Normally we use the word efficiency to measure [energy output]/[energy input]. For a heat pump, we\u2019re measuring [energy moved]/[energy input].\n\nBecause there already is heat outside, even when it feels cold out to us, heat pumps have an advantage. They don\u2019t have to turn the electricity they consume directly into heat, they just have to move the heat from outside your house to inside. In most conditions, heat pumps are actually able to move more than one unit of heat energy using one unit of electrical energy. Therefore, they usually have an efficiency greater than 100%."

                "Content": "From the article: President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office was hard on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which assesses risks to human health and the environment. Political appointees meddled in science-based decisions and its workforce eroded. Now, agency scientists and outside observers fear a repeat, or worse. The upheaval \u201cis going to be swift and unprecedented,\u201d predicts Matthew Tejada of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who left EPA last year. \u201cThey really are scared,\u201d toxicologist Dan Costa, who retired from EPA in 2018, says of the agency researchers he\u2019s in touch with.\n\nLast week, Trump announced Lee Zeldin, a former congressional representative from New York, as his pick to lead the agency. Zeldin\u2019s environmental record is scant and mixed. Along with 22 other Republicans, Zeldin voted to create drinking water standards for some \u201cforever chemicals\u201d\u2014the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that contaminate much of the nation\u2019s groundwater. He also voted against Trump\u2019s plan to expand offshore oil and gas drilling. But in a post on the social media platform X after the appointment announcement, the politician echoed Trump when he said at EPA he would strive for U.S. \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d\n\nMany industry groups hope the incoming administration will loosen environmental regulations. The American Chemistry Council, which advocates for the chemical industry, is calling for EPA to shed restrictive rules and accelerate approval of new chemicals. The American Petroleum Institute said it hopes the agency will revoke regulations on vehicle emissions and fees on methane emissions from oil and gas production.\n\nThe scientific justification for such rules comes from EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development (ORD), an 1800-person office that analyzes what\u2019s known about chemicals and pollution. During the first Trump administration, political appointees interfered with chemical assessments, such as a toxicity report that had been prepared for a PFAS chemical called perfluorobutane sulfonic acid. Trump appointees changed part of the analysis so the chemical might look less hazardous. In a report released last year, the agency\u2019s inspector general found that the last-minute fight caused \u201cdelay, confusion, and significant changes\u201d to the assessment."

The working class needs fossil fuels to function. Anything that raises prices or reduces supply punishes the working class.

Programs that attempt to tax and penalize and then redistribute money to supposedly poor communities won\u2019t help. Forcing people to buy EVs won\u2019t help. Such policies will elect Republicans. What will help is modernizing the grid to start. \n\nRead Fred Lebrun\u2019s recent op ed in the Albany Times Union about the Superfund Act. He explains the problems better than I can."

America will not be spared and if you are able, it's time to start planning on moving to ensure you HAVE a future. I have just finished reading a book entitled: On the Move. Here's a snippet of what it's about: Humanity is on the precipice of a great climate migration, and Americans will not be spared. Tens of millions of people are likely to be driven from the places they call home. Poorer communities will be left behind, while growth will surge in the cities and regions most attractive to climate refugees. America will be changed utterly.\n\nAbrahm Lustgarten\u2019s\u00a0*On the Move*\u00a0is the definitive account of what this massive population shift might look like. As he shows, the United States will be rendered unrecognizable by four unstoppable forces: wildfires in the West; frequent flooding in coastal regions; extreme heat and humidity in the South; and droughts that will make farming all but impossible across much of the nation.\n\nReporting from the front lines of climate migration, Lustgarten explains how a pattern of shortsighted policies encouraged millions to settle in vulnerable parts of the country, and introduces us to homeowners in California, insurance customers in Florida, and ranchers in Colorado who are being forced to make the agonizing choice of when, not whether, to leave. Employing the most current climate data and predictive models, he shows how America\u2019s population will be squeezed northward into a shrinking triangle of land stretching from Tennessee to Maine to the Great Lakes. The places many of us now call home are at risk, and\u00a0*On the Move*\u00a0reveals how we\u2019ll deal with the consequences.\n\nAs a mom who's trying to relocate back to Los Angeles to be near my only surviving child, I'm so concerned about her future, but she loves where she lives, and I love her. Unfortunately, love will not save us."

I'm from Maine, we're getting hit harder than most places in the world. I'm currently sitting through a 50\u00b0F rainstorm in December. \n\nI've started getting this subreddit recommended to me recently (rarely use Reddit anymore) and all I see every day is this depressing, millenial nihilism that insists there's nothing we can do, extinction is around the corner, there's no point to anything. Any bad news is responded with \"well now its all over\", and any good news is countered with \"it's not enough and its too late, this is the end of life as we know it\". \n\nYou guys need to stop. Life will not end. Humanity won't end. We aren't doing nothing. Millions of us are out there right now fighting to keep emissions down, introduce clean energy, and conserve all plant and animal life we can. We're introducing new plans and technologies every day to keep our industries running, our homes together, and our lives intact, all so you can sit here on Reddit and whine about how none of it matters. How about you get off your couch, do something, and stop crying about how none of it matters? \n\nAll you're doing is convincing people to do nothing. We are doing what we can, and we need more people on board. More people who are convinced, YES, WE CAN DO SOMETHING. Nihilism will be the death of us, not every little trickle of bad news, or every new drop of data. \n\nGet off Reddit. Stop whining. It's not over. \n\nYou can do something, we can fix this. Instead of being the people who stood by and watched the world end, we could be the generation that saved the world.\n\nThats all I suppose. Thank you to all of you who help, and fo those who haven't given up.\n\nHave a good night everyone!"

Most of us here practice a form of climate realism (often confused for nihilism if you don\u2019t understand the implications of the latest science). \n\nClimate realism is an acceptance that we are on the absolute worst trajectory and that taking small actions (like driving less or recycling more) are not at all sufficient for the scale of the problem. Two sides of climate realism include optimistic realism (that we can actually change the trajectory through collective action, but requiring a transformation of our social, political, and economic systems at unprecedented rates) and pragmatic realism (that we won\u2019t change the trajectory, so we must invest all our time and resources to preparing for the inevitable compounding catastrophes). There may be others, but they all share an acceptance of reality.\n\nI think the actual issue is your stance. You are blaming the people who care the most, who are most up to date on the latest science, who have seen progress continually stifled by politicians and corporations. The reason we are realists here is because everyone else (read that as the \u201cclimate unconcerned\u201d) are precisely that\u2026 unconcerned. Go over to one of the conservative subs and tell them to get off the couch and you\u2019ll get banned. \n\nWe aren\u2019t the ones telling people to do nothing. We just want people to accept reality and be as concerned as we are. My guess is if you trace the climate nihilist message to its roots you\u2019ll find it originated elsewhere. \n\nYou are welcome here to join in the conversation. If you see any nihilists, help shove them in the right direction\u2026 towards realism."

                "Content": "One of the biggest fallacies in the climate movement is misinterpreting scales. The logic is usually as follows: if all humans take small actions, this will add up to significant change. This, unfortunately, is not how climate change works. Small actions at the individual level are great for one thing only - creating the sense that one is making a difference (leading to reduced climate anxiety). The reality is that action has to occur at the scale of the problem\u2026 so driven by corporations and federal governments. We can do our part as activists to push and pull those with the power, but they have consistently shown for more than 50 years that they are unwilling to change. \n\nFor a personal example. I am a climate researcher and activist who has multiple degrees and decades of experience fighting for change and working with at-risk communities. I now work for my local government, since that is the frontline of climate impacts. In our community we ran the numbers and found it would cost us close to $1 billion over 10 years to reach community-wide zero emissions (we are already net zero). That is our entire community\u2019s economy times 100 for that period. And how much would we reduce global emissions? .0000000001% \n\nThe same investment (again not even possible) would guarantee very single person is protected from climate impacts (fires, floods, sea level rise), that we can have a self-reliant food system (no more exports, resilient to droughts), and that we could be a refuge for climate refugees for decades to come. We are a super privileged area of the world, so I know this will not be possible for most communities. \n\nI never tell my community to do nothing. But if they have a choice between buying an EV or making their home flood proof, I always recommend the later. \n\nI wish that our actions mattered more. But the reality is that people need to know small actions will never be enough. We need transformation. Anything less will just mean we aren\u2019t ready for what is coming (or as this year has shown, what is already here)."

While it\u2019s important to share accurate information and avoid amplifying misinformation, Burley argues that fascist myths must be countered through community-building. \u201cThe antidote to this is already happening,\u201d Burley said. \u201cMutual aid networks ground people back in their communities, fill the gaps left by fragmented public services, and create a steady stream of reliable information among communities facing technological challenges.\u201d\n\nDon't scream at people taken in by conspiracy theories. We have to reintegrate our communities based on real world interactions and social relationships.\n\nPeople which are taken in by this kind of unevidenced belief don't respond to data. They respond to positive human interaction and emotional connection.\n\nAs an aside on the point about \"fragmented communities\" this is yet another evil of capitalism. The capitalist class want to tear down the fabric of all our public services and public wealth so that they can be replaced with for-profit, paid-for replacements. Capitalism is not only antithetical to democracy, it's antithetical to a strong, cohesive and vibrant society. As Margaret Thatcher approvingly observed herself in her infamous \"There is no such thing as society\" quote."

Weird, haven't seen that happen throughout history... oh wait.\nSeveral authoritarian regimes throughout history have targeted and slaughtered intellectuals, often viewing them as threats to their power due to their ability to influence public opinion or lead resistance movements. Notable examples include:\n\nSoviet Union under Stalin (The Great Purge, 1936\u20131938):\n\nStalin's regime targeted intellectuals, writers, artists, and academics during the Great Purge. Many were executed or sent to gulags as they were seen as potential sources of dissent. Intellectuals who didn't align with the regime\u2019s ideological control were purged.\nKhmer Rouge in Cambodia (1975\u20131979):\n\nPol Pot's regime viewed intellectuals as enemies of the state and sought to eradicate them. Anyone perceived as educated, including teachers, doctors, and even people who wore glasses, was executed. This genocide killed up to 2 million people.\nCultural Revolution in China (1966\u20131976):\n\nLed by Mao Zedong, the Cultural Revolution sought to purge Chinese society of bourgeois elements, including intellectuals and scholars. Academics were publicly humiliated, imprisoned, tortured, and often killed. Universities were shut down, and intellectuals were sent to labor camps.\nNazi Germany (1933\u20131945):\n\nThe Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler persecuted intellectuals who opposed its ideology, especially Jewish intellectuals, communists, and socialists. Many were sent to concentration camps or forced into exile. The Nazis also burned books and suppressed free thought and scientific progress.\nArgentina\u2019s Dirty War (1976\u20131983):\n\nThe military dictatorship in Argentina targeted intellectuals, journalists, and academics as part of its campaign against perceived left-wing activists. Thousands were \u201cdisappeared,\u201d tortured, and killed.\nFrancoist Spain (1939\u20131975):\n\nUnder Francisco Franco, intellectuals who supported the Republic or had leftist ideologies were executed, imprisoned, or forced into exile."
