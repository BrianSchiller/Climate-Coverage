See [CO2 Coalition](https://co2coalition.org).\n- The \u2018partial\u2019 group includes [Willie Soon\u2019s article](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/9/179) about the urban bias inherent in the IPCC models, concluding that\n>Meanwhile, we found that simply substituting an alternative solar forcing dataset to that considered by AR6\u2019s climate model hindcasts can substantially increase the amount of the 1850\u20132018 warming that can be explained in terms of natural forcing from 21% to 70% of the long-term warming implied by the \u201crural and urban\u201d series and 87% of the \u201crural-only\u201d temperature series.\n- The \u2018practically all\u2019 group is the IPCC.\n\nIn this group, we tend to poke fun at the latter, but amidst the memes and ridicule, there are legitimate posts to scientific studies, supporting the all or mostly natural point of view.\n\nThere is a 97% agreement that IPCC is wrong \u2026 OK, I made the statistic up, but my guess is it\u2019s accurate.",

Now, long-term tide gages, and recently satellite radars (NOT IMAGERY) are in agreement here that the rate is about \\~3mm globally. You can believe that this SLR is insignificant, or you can disagree with the data, idk what you believe. Regardless, 'potential risks' are not unfounded, as I work in coastal flooding, so an increase of 0.5m would increase the chance of low-lying areas and important assets getting flooded- some areas are only 3m above sea level, so SLR with high tides or waves can be significant. Look up nuisance flooding as a simple example. Also I work with sea grasses which are very sensitive to water depth, and 0.5m will impact to their already small habitable area. Develop an understanding of nuisance flooding or sea grass ecosystems before commenting further because straight dismissal is not helpful. \n\nI don't care what Al Gore is saying so that is not relevant. I've already agreed that it was alarmist.\n\nAgain I've outlined why 30 meter resolution satellite images are NOT useful to measure 16cm of SLR. Coming back to that point doesn't support anything, and before you do please look into different satellite instruments and their uses. \n\nThere are more credible predictions of future sea levels or climate predictions and less credible ones. People will use less credible predictions because they are alarmist and get more media/public attention, but that doesn't make it credible. There are plenty of scientists that use more conservative SLR predictions, but they don't get the media attention. So your understanding of climate change is biased due to media and politics, which is a huge issue and not your fault. I have deep qualms with the state of science regarding this matter.\n\nLol not a whack job, but appreciate the name calling, really says a lot about me wasting my time with you. I'm not the one thinking using satellite imagery is SLR gotcha, so I hope you at least acknowledge this oversight before you continue looking like a fool. \n\nMy take on climate change is very nuanced, I'm sorry you can't appreciate that. I'm very against climate alarmism, but do see value in a changing public perception to protect natural resources given the history of their recent destruction.

SLR over 40 years can't be observed along the coast from satellites at 30m resolution. The primary cause of coastline change over the past 40 years is due to sediment supply for most areas. In other words, 0.4m SLR with a coastline slope of 0.2 would be 2m of horizontal migration - as an example that 30m satellite imagery isn't useful for this analysis. This doesn't account for the multitude of other factors that are in play along the coast. \n\nI would recommend you look at monthly mean sea levels such as here if you're curious about SLR:\n\n[https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends\\_station.shtml?id=9414290](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=9414290)\n\nWe'll see if this rate increases, but even after 100 yrs, it likely won't be visible from satellites on most shorelines, but can be detrimental in regions where ecosystems and coastlines cannot migrate. For example, my concern is for sea grass ecosystems, where 0.5m SLR reduces potential habitat space. Overall, the bigger issue is developed coastlines preventing natural coastline response to oceanographic conditions or sea level changes. \n\nI also see you linking Al Gore's take, which is \\~2 decades old and was even alarmist at the time.",

Because his co2 calc is based on a surface temp of 288K (bottom of pg 262 of below Arrhenius link)\n\n[https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896\\_tcm18-173546.pdf](https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf)\n\nAfter that paper, Ekholm wrote a paper in 1901, calculating the surface temp being 15.1C\n\n[https://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE\\_ClassicArticles/archives/classic\\_articles/issue1\\_global\\_warming/n5.\\_Ekholm\\_\\_1901.pdf](https://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE_ClassicArticles/archives/classic_articles/issue1_global_warming/n5._Ekholm__1901.pdf)\n\nNow heres the crux, Arrhenius was calculating that co2 would increase atmospheric temp as co2 was increased, and used 15C/288K as the basis of that calc - and today, the surface temp is observed/calc'd to be the same, ie 15C. \n\nAnd yet we're told that the 'pre-industrial period' (from 1850-1900) the surface temp was supposed to be around 13.7C - so that the warming since then has been 1.3C. But  where does the idea that the 1890's were  cooler than today come from? - tree ring and coral rings data and climate models that ASSUME the past was cooler, and because they ASSUME co2 causes warming - therefore if today is 15C, the past must be cooler.....ie the climate models hindcast temps. And as per YOUR quoted paper - they are wrong.\n\nSo if co2 is causing warming, why has the surface temp not changed in 128yrs? and why were Arrhenius' calcs wrong? - we've had a 50% increase in co2 since 1896 (280ppm) and temp is still the same?",

Temperatures below X amount. The other person I was just speaking with said 285ppm is the best value.\n\nWhile I could agree, CO2 levels are increasing (exponentially), I don't see the same exponential in ocean levels and temperature (again not posting links). \n\nNor do I see where todays changes exceed previous recent history. From oceans being 400ft lower than today. Glaciers being miles deep. We have ample natural examples of previous rates of change far, far exceeding todays. What makes now special?",

Firstly, it causes the water to sublimate into water vapor that rises and becomes clouds, which reflect the sun's heat. \n\nAs a SCUBA diver, I have seen how quickly the sun's light falls off as you descend. Red light is nearly non existent beyond 20 feet. Green and blue light goes much deeper, which is why the ocean looks sorta blue green.\n\nI would imagine the ocean bottom at the equator might be a little warmer than it is at the poles, but I don't think it's a huge difference. The depths are COLD. Diving off south Florida in the summertime, surface temperature water would be in the 80s. At 50 feet it'd be in the 60s and getting colder the deeper you go.",

In an opinion column titled \u201cFive Lies About Tobacco,\u201d Bast once repeatedly claimed that health concerns regarding cigarette smoking were overblown and worth ignoring. At first, Bast denied that he had ever dismissed concerns about smoking and disputed the quote we read to him.\n\n>\u201dIn 1998, you wrote in a Heartland op-ed that smoking cigarettes has little to no adverse health effects,\u201d we noted. \u201cDo you stand by that?\u201d\n\n>\u201dNo, I never wrote that,\u201d replied Bast. \u201cWhy would I have written something like that?\u201d Bast asked to see the op-ed, and promised to \u201ccontest\u201d it.\n\n>Later, Republic Report returned and read Bast\u2019s op-ed to him. Watch the video below:\n\n>After reading his op-ed to him \u2014 which claimed moderate smoking is not deadly and has \u201cfew, if any adverse health effects\u201d \u2014 Bast then reaffirmed his comments, but hedged, arguing that he meant \u201cone or two cigarettes a day or week.\u201d We read another line from his piece, which at the time claimed up to seven cigarettes a day does not raise the risk of lung cancer. Bast again confirmed his sentiment.\n\n>Heartland has gone to great lengths to argue that its attacks on public health or climate science are not motivated by the vast amounts of funding it receives from industry groups. But again, the tobacco wars are an instructive reminder of Heartland\u2019s agenda.\n\nhttps://www.prwatch.org/news/2014/05/12464/heartland-institute-reluctantly-stands-denial-cigarette-smoking-risks",

In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs. In 2022, another 133 were demolished. According to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, Spain has been a leading exponent of dam removal. Last year it was second only to France, and the year before that it topped the EU league for dismantling them.\n\nReuters claims a debunk https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/map-shows-existing-river-barriers-not-dams-removed-before-deadly-valencia-floods-2024-11-11/\n\nIMO this mirrors the EU ecobureaucrat fiasco of recent decades of not dredging rivers, in the name of making Nature happy, rivers that had been dredged in prior centuries, then with less space in the rivers meant more flooding, more citizens lives damaged. More broadly it mirrors many dilettantish things Western govts have been doing.  \n\nI am not sure about the dams. But I do know the same people first went after CO2 . then methane, then nitrogen,and now dams.. these ecowarrior bureaucrats are nasty & stupid and they are something betwen dreamers and religious nuts.\n\nbtw in related news the science-less  editor of \"scientific american\" has been forced to resign.

Few working Americans can privilege long-term concern for the planet as a whole over concern about paying monthly bills for their home. Any legislation that increases net costs of energy ripples outward to increase the cost of living overall. My own support for climate progress is much more in the direction of cost-effective sustainable energy development and efficiency-incentives over stopping or even limiting oil and gas from anywhere with an already well-developed petroleum industry (the question of drilling in wilderness and ecologically-sensitive *new* sites is a different story in my book, but that's probably largely because I'm a middle class tree hugger...)",

                "Content": "Your comment is based on a very common confusion brought about by climate alarmists Misinforming you about what climate skeptics believe.\n\nClearly, you think that climate skeptics do not think that there is global warming. Which is why you think your reference to calculus proves us wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to advise you that climate skeptics simply believe that man-made activity is not responsible for whatever global warming that actually exists, and we also believe that the science is publicly spun and misrepresented to blame human activity.\n\nThe idea that there is global warming of some amount is not contested although there might be arguments over the accuracy of the amount of warming as it is understood publicly.\n\nIt is also important to understand that the mainstream claim of climate activists is not that it is just natural global warming, but that human beings are causing the global warming by emitting more carbon dioxide.\n\nIt is common knowledge to everyone here, but perhaps not to you that since the 70s human carbon emissions are increasing rapidly every decade.\n\nThe evidence that since the 70s the rate of warming has not increased, contradicts the claim that it is our carbon dioxide use that is the cause of the warming, \n\nThat is because we produce more and more carbon dioxide every year, if we were responsible for driving the warming we should\u2019ve seen an increase in the rate of warming. \n\nThis influence could be represented by the second order derivative d2T/dt2, and clearly this latest study indicates that this is zero. \n\nThe fact that the rate of warming remains constant discredits the claims of climate change activists.\n\nSo therefore you are correct when you say that the title proves global warming, which has never been in question by climate skeptics, but it disproves man-made global warming due to carbon emissions which is what climate skeptics care about.\n\nAnd just the final point. It is clear that when many people say global warming, what they really mean is man-made global warming due to carbon emissions, I suggest you start forcing the distinction in order to avoid this type of confusion in the future.",

The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming \u2013 leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.\u2019 \n\n> No doubt in BBC-world they actually believe that polar bears are dying out. It is, after all, an article of faith for the global warming cult. However, far from declining, the world\u2019s population of polar bears has tripled since the 1960s, thanks to the ban on hunting in 1973.",

                "Content": "In the 1970s, the propaganda was \"global cooling.\" Now it's \"global warming.\" \n\nThis season is not that serious. This isn't the first time a hurricane went that far inland. This isn't the first time a state saw back to back major hurricanes. See 1900 when a hurricane leveled Galveston Island. See the dust bowl of the 1930s.  See 1993 when a bomb cyclone buried Appalachia in snow. See 2005 when Louisiana when they got hit with back to back hurricanes. See 2016 when West Virginia hollers drowned in 1000-year flooding. No one can say the propaganda was nearly as strong then as it is now. That isn't a coincidence.\n\nI've made this point in other subreddits. One problem is that plebians of progressive society don't know how to decifer raw data from \"data-based\" products. Most people, like you people, get your information from either propaganda or \"data-based\" products. \"Data-based\" products are things like the graphs and charts you find. Most people of progressive society misinterpret these products and use them as if they are raw data. Raw data gives you true values, like temps, densities, humidity, pressures, thicknesses, and so on. In meteorology, these values are always coded. It's the numeric value that a sensor records and sends to a database to be collected and referenced. However, now trained people (which usually work for a given government) have to decode those values to be applied in a presentation so that a given audience can understand them. Now, audiences range; that can be higher officers of the military conducting a military operation, or that can be simple-minded progressives or neo-cons that need to be influenced to accept a narrative. The products will be different, and only certain types of products are available depending on who you are.\n\nThe other problem is that most people don't know how to decifer true information from propaganda.",

I know a bit about how the weather is recorded and reported. \n\n>Every single field of science and technology has improved its understanding of its field since the 1970s,\n\nYou are only agreeing with my point in a way. Just because our means of recording weather is developing does not mean the weather itself is changing in the way it is propagandized to appear. We have more means of observing every corner of society and nature than we did 100 years ago, just like the use and creation of propaganda has developed. So just because we have more information recorded now doesn't mean that the same or similar information wasn't already present in the distant past. With this kind of development, the benchmark is something unknowable because our means of recording back then was not as in-depth as it is now. But I just listed several instances that should prove that disastrous natural events are not new.\n\n>That's a very long winded way of trying to claim the reason you can't find any data that backs up your thesis \n\nWell I gotta try to explain as thoroughly as I can because you people aren't actually that smart. Like you missed my whole explanation separating \"data\" from \"products\". \"Products\" in this case are things prepared for the one who is proposed to digest what is presented, while \"data\" is where these products come from, which in meteorology, is *always* encoded. The thing is that there's no way to trust where the data comes from because of the second problem I explained: progressive society neither can't or won't decifer propaganda from true information. \n\nHowever, never fear, the agenda of the establishment is working. You people get to go along with everything the state-owned media puts in front of you, and life is easier for the duration of your attention span.",

                "Content": "> the idea that wind stops at night everywhere - which seems to be what he's implying - is fallacy. \n\n[Cold without wind: German \u2018dunkelflaute\u2019 brings electricity prices to crisis levels and depletes gas reserves](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-12-12/cold-without-wind-german-dunkelflaute-brings-electricity-prices-to-crisis-levels-and-depletes-gas-reserves.html)\n\n> Dunkelflaute is a cursed word in the German electricity sector. The combination, typical of cold anticyclones, of low temperatures (which increase demand) and the almost total absence of wind (which hinders wind generation) configures one of the worst possible scenarios for the price of electricity: it forces the burning of more gas in combined cycle plants, which are much more expensive, and that substantially increases the bill. This dreaded cocktail, which is currently hitting Central Europe, is leading the price of electricity in Europe\u2019s largest economy to levels not seen since the energy crisis.\n\n[Sweden Blasts Germany For Rising Electricity Prices](https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/sweden-blasts-germany-for-rising-electricity-prices-88720)\n\n> Germany's recent power issues stemmed from what has been described as \"Dunkelflaute,\" where neither wind nor solar power can meet demand. This led to energy prices soaring after the country experienced low renewable output.

There is a time and place.\n\nMy biggest argument against renewables is, even if the wind stops blowing for just one day a year, there needs to be a whole backup system sitting there not used for the other 364 days of the year to cover the shortfall. That's wasteful, expensive, inefficient. Those gas turbines need to be sitting on idle ready to go. The system needs to be overbuilt to compensate.\n\nSure batteries, pumped hydro, etc can rectify this to a degree, but these are also expensive, environmental impact, two systems need to be maintained, dams, water turbines, batteies, etc.\n\nIf the wind never stopped, I'd be all for the wind to be part of the energy mix.",

The video is a cut-down version of a much longer discussion and therefore lacks some context.\n\nWhat the speaker is implying is wind and solar are only available for a fraction of each day. That might vary, but it's typically only 20%. However, as you've pointed out, there are places where availability is more than that. But I'm sure wind turbines do not operate 100% of the time anywhere, even the place you mentioned. \n\nAlso wind turbines require a steady wind between \\~43 km/h  to \\~80 km/h to operate. This further reduces their operating availability.",

        "Content": "If Big Oil's role in pushing for the climate change agenda was not clear yet (it a) helps them to sell their oil at a higher price and b) pushes independent smaller oil companies who undercut them with shale oil out of the market), here is another explicit statement how Big Oil benefits from the Paris Agreement.\n\n# [Exxon Warns Trump Against Leaving Paris Agreement](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Exxon-Warns-Trump-Against-Leaving-Paris-Agreement.html)\n\nExxon\u2019s chief executive has warned president-elect Donald Trump it would be a bad idea to leave the Paris Agreement on climate change, saying it would create uncertainty for the business world.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the stops and starts are the right thing for businesses,\u201d Darren Woods\u00a0[told](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/exxon-says-trump-should-keep-u-s-in-paris-climate-pact-3d8de471)\u00a0the Wall Street Journal in an interview. \u201cIt is extremely inefficient. It creates a lot of uncertainty.\u201d If Trump pulls the U.S. out of the emissions accord, businesses would likely suffer because it is counterproductive for them \u201cto have the pendulum swing back and forth as administrations change.\u201d\n\nTrump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement during his first term in keeping with his stance that climate change is not the catastrophic existential threat it is being made out to be. There appears to be a general agreement that he would try to do the same during this term as well.\n\n**Exxon, however, has staked billions on the energy transition, especially in the carbon capture segment**. Last year, the company paid $5 billion for Denbury Resources, a carbon dioxide pipeline network operator. Besides that acquisition, Exxon has also recently signed three more deals for carbon capture and storage, one with CF Industries, one with industrial gas makers Linde, and one with steelmaker Nucor. Earlier this year Exxon also said it had teamed up with Shell to develop carbon capture and storage solutions for Singapore.\n\nCarbon capture and storage is the obvious choice for many oil producers who want to reduce their carbon footprint\u2014or help others reduce theirs. Investment, however, needs to expand considerably under net-zero scenarios.\n\nWith a view to all these investments already made, it really would be uncertainty-inducing if Trump lifts the Paris Agreement obligation for companies to reduce their emissions. However, it does not mean he would ban them from reducing their emissions in any way they see fit, including through carbon capture.\n\nBy Irina Slav for [Oilprice.com](http://Oilprice.com) Nov 12, 2024, 2:01 AM CST",
