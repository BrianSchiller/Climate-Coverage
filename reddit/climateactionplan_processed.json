Despite living in the Midwest, I've gotten to be something of an Amtrak expert at this point. I recommend Rome2Rio (app or website) for finding alternatives to flying or driving - though if you have an EV perhaps you'd just use that. I have found that avoiding driving has made me really appreciate kicking back in a train though, especially if you can afford to spring for a roomette. \n\nMy things to add for this upcoming year are similar to your electric vehicle idea - I joined an EV carshare and I'm getting an ebike - I can't wait!!\n\nThe only thing \"missing\" I'd mention is getting involved in political solutions, which can seem intimidating but can be as easy as sending a couple pre-written emails! I really like the app Climate Action Now for ease of use, but I also get a lot of action items in my email by subscribing to groups like the Sierra Club, Evergreen Action, the High Speed Rail Alliance and Rail Passengers Association - the latter two being very important if we're going to get people to fly less in this country.",

                "Content": "It was easy enough to program the thermostat to \"bank\" during daylight hours, then idle during peak residential demand.  It's a small thing, but I'll be damned if I am going to do anything favorable to the economics of peaker plant operators.   \n\nIt was also easy to make liberal use of the timers on the washer or dryer, so I don't need to be present to load them at specific times of day.  \n\nI've found the inputs requirement of backyard agriculture to not be worthwhile.  The requirements for embodied energy in the form of amendments, plus all the labor and monitoring don't add up to a reasonable amount of yield.  Most people don't even know how to track their amendment use, and it just adds up to watershed  contamination.  Ergo, all I grow now are herbs.  One mint pot probably puts out enough for the whole neighborhood.\n\nComposting benefits from larger pile dimensions.  It's not a magical embetterment process, but really a hazard mitigation process.  If something is a safe, or pathogen free material, it can be added into the growing area to compost directly in situ.  This tends to confer more nitrogen and carbon residues in place.  Where composting has a benefit, is the heat, which helps break down some unwanted seeds or other propagative tissue.  Anywhere it is cool, they tend to survive, and mobile organisms will likely take those materials with them as they migrate to an optimal temperature.  Ergo, you need an even larger pile, and the means to move it around, or access the most well treated components.",

Nothing against how other people I live, I just feel good to notice what I'm doing through others\n\n-My stupid city finally introduced more easy access to recycling, (which literally made me happy) so I started sorting blue bin items, trash and food scraps instead of just collecting bottles to take to a far away centre once a month. Now everything gets picked up here from bins, with more options around for other wastes. Though I have yet to make use of reuse centers.\n\n-I don't own a car despite having a drivers license, and as convenient as it would be to have a sustainable one for some situations, I rely on public transit, public scooters and walking\n\n-Bought reusable things I never thought I'd own before like wooden straws, my own fancy pair of chopsticks for take out, rubber covers for opened food items instead of plastic wrap (where I can) and jars/containers in place of Ziploc bags\n\n-I'm thinking of donating my disfunctional printer to a rage room, and then entering said rage room to smash it\n\n\nWhat I still need to do better on\n\n-Not wasting water during long showers. I'm good for not leaving the sap running when spending the night at someone's place, but I think not having to pay for it where I live- as well as loving hot, cozy showers. That one is a work in progress\n\n-Despite food scrap sorting, I need to work on not wasting food by failing to use something before it goes bad.

This initiative has provided over 30,000 rental homes with energy-efficient upgrades, including solar panels, energy-efficient windows, and floodproofing measures. These enhancements are designed to reduce energy costs, lower carbon emissions, and increase the safety of buildings during extreme weather events. Residents, such as seniors in New Orleans and Pittsburgh, have noted that these improvements address longstanding maintenance issues and offer greater security during natural disasters.\n\nAdrianne Todman, HUD\u2019s deputy secretary, emphasized that the program brings subsidized units into the 21st century, ensuring that low-income individuals are not left behind in the nation\u2019s energy improvements. By lowering utility bills and increasing energy efficiency, these upgrades not only combat climate change but also enhance the health and safety of vulnerable residents nationwide. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of integrating environmental sustainability with social equity, particularly in housing policies affecting low-income communities.",

                "Content": "For any australians who like me get tired with how much libs have kept us on the backburner when it comes to climate action and how much time they waste every week with their stalling now with their nuclear plan which is full of holes this should be encouraging\n\n\"i\u2019s difficult to overstate how rapidly Australians have embraced solar power, and how much it has exceeded expectations. In 2011, the forecast was that rooftop solar would eventually contribute 4 terawatt hours of electricity. In the context of the Australian grid, this was next to nothing \u2013 barely 2% of total generation. For some, it raised the question of whether it was really worth the cost.\n\nMore than a decade on, that number has been eclipsed more than six times over in the five eastern states connected by the country\u2019s main power grid. Rooftop solar panels connected to the National Electricity Market generated 24.6TWh over the last year of data.\n\nPut another way, homes have contributed 11.6% of electricity \u2013 nearly as much as windfarms, comfortably more than large-scale solar farms or hydro plants, and twice as much as gas-fired power.\n\nMore than 3.7m households and small businesses have solar systems. It means more than one in three homes across the country generate their own power when the sun is out.\"\n\nThat is how much we were able to in a decade and show some of that is due to the government and states in part making solar panel installation cheaper but it is also absolutely on the australina people for so actively making the change themselves. I am confident when electric cars and power station start to pop up we will also quickly adopt although that has some challenges here",

The educational systems can include sustainable construction in the curriculum.

Addressing these emissions requires informed material choices to minimize environmental impact.\n\nKey discussions in sustainable construction focus on decarbonizing building services through smarter energy management, as emphasized by Schneider Electric, and scaling low-carbon infrastructure, a priority for organizations like Arcadis, which explores strategies to enable large-scale reductions in embodied carbon. Designing for sustainability is also critical, with firms like Gensler highlighting the importance of material transparency and carbon considerations to ensure future-ready buildings. Practical approaches to enhance material reuse and recycling are being demonstrated by tools developed by the Hilti Group, which assess products based on multi-attribute sustainability.\n\nThese efforts align with broader initiatives such as embodied carbon reduction goals and fostering a circular economy in the built environment. Learn more about reducing construction emissions through resources like environmental product declarations and life-cycle assessment guidelines.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on practical steps for reducing embodied carbon in construction?",

Reducing heating-requirements of buildings is more important than the actual energy that goes into the building.   \n2. Build slow and reduce waste. Large construction firms waste tremendous amounts of materials and energy. Instead learn from the amish or similar cobuilding initiatives.  \n3. Right type of buildings. Don't build huge steel/concrete highrises when you can make 3-4 story apartment buildings completely out of wood and with reclaimed or local materials.  \n4. Build housing with and for the people. Banks should require proof of use or tenants signed up before giving any credit or loans to developers. Today lots of buildings are pure investments that stand empty most of the time.   \n5. Provide more than just housing. Like [sharphill.org](http://sharphill.org) that wants to build ecovillages with local agriculture and embedded co-ops to reduce commuting and share equity. It helps the climate, creates social justice and decentralization that better can endure eventual disasters/crisis.",

I'm working on creating some general talking points about climate change, it's effects, alternative power sources to gas and coal, etc.\n\nI'd love to point to some paper or website or pamphlet that proves that renewables are cheaper (or similarly priced)and capable of giving us all of the energy we need. I know the needed mix between wind and solar is dependant on location (I'm in WI). \n\nOur state utilities are asking to build several more natural gas plants because Microsoft is trying to build large data centers here and will need a ton of energy.\n\nAnyway, I was looking to see if there were any talking points about natural gas vs renewable so that I don't need to recreate the wheel. \n\nAlso I'm curious what other states have done to force more investment in renewable energy. I know Iowa had created a law to require a certain amount of energy be produced from wind...any other laws I should look up?",
