Ideally increased nuclear power reduces the cost due to economies of scale in a way that might allow us to more easily phase out fossils, but any phasing-out of fossils is merely a speculative side-effect rather than stated intent."

Plus, the embodied carbon footprint of nuclear (caveat: conventional reactors since that\u2019s what\u2019s been built) is lower than that of solar and about that of wind (https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf#page=7\u00a0- embodied CO2 is on page 7).\u00a0\n\nFor cost, SMRs have the potential to bring down costs, and other countries (China, South Korea, Canada) have much lower costs to build than Vogtle, showing that we can learn how to build reactors better.\u00a0\n\nMy opinion is that we should be building nuclear like mad.\u00a0"

And that report is overly pessimistic with nuclear (40y lifetime instead of 60+, vogtle costs instead of global average) and assumes 0 transmission cost for renewables (while expanding&maintaining it is extremely costly)  \nYou can also chose to not recycle and vitrify the stuff, very safe option, but it'll be a loss since uranium price will increase when demand grows, meaning recycling is even more favorable.

You can do tech transfer just like Japan did with Orano la Hague.  \nNeedless to say that payment for fuel storage in us is already regulated.

I built two bins outside, one from a Lowe's bucket and another from a tote, also from the same store as the former.\n\nGrowing produce at home. I grew Walmart organic bell peppers from seed with an LED light I'm using as an aquarium light for my 55 gallon freshwater aquarium. I also feed the homegrown peppers to my guinea pigs.\n\nLooking more into home aquaponics. Already doing that with a romaine stalk I have in one of my fish tanks. I want to eventually have all of my fish tanks (freshwater) to grow something aquaponically. I guess being an avid aquarist helps find more sustainable way to get food for not just me, but for my pet guinea pigs.\n\nDoing outdoor gardening as well as the aforementioned aquaponics. I got gardening gloves, shears, and a farmer's almanac for Christmas this year.\n\nHere's some of my long-term goals:\n\nGetting our house solar powered.\n\nNever owning a pure gas vehicle again. I'm looking to get an EV or e bike. In fact, if I remember correctly, I think they're building an EV battery factory just between Savannah and Statesboro on I-16.\n\nBonus: Our gas tank that supplies gas for heaters for the winter months; we've ditched them for a central heat and air system.",

Despite living in the Midwest, I've gotten to be something of an Amtrak expert at this point. I recommend Rome2Rio (app or website) for finding alternatives to flying or driving - though if you have an EV perhaps you'd just use that. I have found that avoiding driving has made me really appreciate kicking back in a train though, especially if you can afford to spring for a roomette. \n\nMy things to add for this upcoming year are similar to your electric vehicle idea - I joined an EV carshare and I'm getting an ebike - I can't wait!!\n\nThe only thing \"missing\" I'd mention is getting involved in political solutions, which can seem intimidating but can be as easy as sending a couple pre-written emails! I really like the app Climate Action Now for ease of use, but I also get a lot of action items in my email by subscribing to groups like the Sierra Club, Evergreen Action, the High Speed Rail Alliance and Rail Passengers Association - the latter two being very important if we're going to get people to fly less in this country."

It's a small thing, but I'll be damned if I am going to do anything favorable to the economics of peaker plant operators.   \n\nIt was also easy to make liberal use of the timers on the washer or dryer, so I don't need to be present to load them at specific times of day.  \n\nI've found the inputs requirement of backyard agriculture to not be worthwhile.  The requirements for embodied energy in the form of amendments, plus all the labor and monitoring don't add up to a reasonable amount of yield.  Most people don't even know how to track their amendment use, and it just adds up to watershed  contamination.  Ergo, all I grow now are herbs.  One mint pot probably puts out enough for the whole neighborhood.\n\nComposting benefits from larger pile dimensions.  It's not a magical embetterment process, but really a hazard mitigation process.  If something is a safe, or pathogen free material, it can be added into the growing area to compost directly in situ.  This tends to confer more nitrogen and carbon residues in place.  Where composting has a benefit, is the heat, which helps break down some unwanted seeds or other propagative tissue.  Anywhere it is cool, they tend to survive, and mobile organisms will likely take those materials with them as they migrate to an optimal temperature.  Ergo, you need an even larger pile, and the means to move it around, or access the most well treated components."

Nothing against how other people I live, I just feel good to notice what I'm doing through others\n\n-My stupid city finally introduced more easy access to recycling, (which literally made me happy) so I started sorting blue bin items, trash and food scraps instead of just collecting bottles to take to a far away centre once a month. Now everything gets picked up here from bins, with more options around for other wastes. Though I have yet to make use of reuse centers.\n\n-I don't own a car despite having a drivers license, and as convenient as it would be to have a sustainable one for some situations, I rely on public transit, public scooters and walking\n\n-Bought reusable things I never thought I'd own before like wooden straws, my own fancy pair of chopsticks for take out, rubber covers for opened food items instead of plastic wrap (where I can) and jars/containers in place of Ziploc bags\n\n-I'm thinking of donating my disfunctional printer to a rage room, and then entering said rage room to smash it\n\n\nWhat I still need to do better on\n\n-Not wasting water during long showers. I'm good for not leaving the sap running when spending the night at someone's place, but I think not having to pay for it where I live- as well as loving hot, cozy showers. That one is a work in progress\n\n-Despite food scrap sorting, I need to work on not wasting food by failing to use something before it goes bad. I'm so sensitive to something potentially expiring that I would throw out something that may still be good just to be safe.\n\n-Come next summer, I want to invest in something I can ride to work instead of public transit. Trying to decide on what though\n\n-Considering recycling or reusing everything else that can be as such but don't go in any of the bins, especially electronics. I wish there were more electronic waste centers around that I can get to\n\n-I live in an apartment, but trust me, if I had a house and could afford to put more greenery around it, I'd do so in a heartbeat"

That's what I did when it felt like I was out of things to do after being vegan, not driving and not flying, and at the time living in an apartment. I've learned SO much and can even claim a small (very small, admittedly, in some cases) portion of several major legislative victories in my state and country, because I met with my elected officials and asked them to vote for them or cosponsor them. Citizens' Climate Lobby is a great organization to join to learn that skill, but there are tons of good organizations to join if you look around. If you don't have time to join, at least sign up for some newsletters so you can send their form letters to your politicians. I promise you, even if it feels silly, it makes a difference."

I'd do an EV but where I'm at, that's not exactly viable. I don't eat a lot of beef to begin with so cutting that down is somewhat insignificant on my end. And since I live with my parents(really cheap rent), I don't have much of a say over whether or not we go renewable.

Unfortunately, due to the continual MSM daily narrative of a doom laden future and brainwashing of children at school, to the disgraceful point where they are scared shitless, while global elites and celebrities fly around in their private jets attending all these nefarious functions on climate change.

                "Content": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has concluded its $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, aimed at modernizing affordable housing across 42 states. This initiative has provided over 30,000 rental homes with energy-efficient upgrades, including solar panels, energy-efficient windows, and floodproofing measures. These enhancements are designed to reduce energy costs, lower carbon emissions, and increase the safety of buildings during extreme weather events. Residents, such as seniors in New Orleans and Pittsburgh, have noted that these improvements address longstanding maintenance issues and offer greater security during natural disasters.\n\nAdrianne Todman, HUD\u2019s deputy secretary, emphasized that the program brings subsidized units into the 21st century, ensuring that low-income individuals are not left behind in the nation\u2019s energy improvements. By lowering utility bills and increasing energy efficiency, these upgrades not only combat climate change but also enhance the health and safety of vulnerable residents nationwide. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of integrating environmental sustainability with social equity, particularly in housing policies affecting low-income communities."

There's a reason ppl scaled up nuclear plants, it's cheaper to build a facility in a single place that generates a lot.

Eg in the case of biobased construction farmers, processors, and builders can go together to build in a sustainable way - and the municipality can prioritise biobased construction in their tenders and support the creation of demand. The educational systems can include sustainable construction in the curriculum. If we go together we can scale up existing biobased solutions. \n\nI am currently working on a project where this is our aim. It is nit easy - but I believe it is possible."

        "Content": "Buildings are responsible for 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with 11% stemming from the materials and processes used in construction. Addressing these emissions requires informed material choices to minimize environmental impact.\n\nKey discussions in sustainable construction focus on decarbonizing building services through smarter energy management, as emphasized by Schneider Electric, and scaling low-carbon infrastructure, a priority for organizations like Arcadis, which explores strategies to enable large-scale reductions in embodied carbon. Designing for sustainability is also critical, with firms like Gensler highlighting the importance of material transparency and carbon considerations to ensure future-ready buildings. Practical approaches to enhance material reuse and recycling are being demonstrated by tools developed by the Hilti Group, which assess products based on multi-attribute sustainability.\n\nThese efforts align with broader initiatives such as embodied carbon reduction goals and fostering a circular economy in the built environment. Learn more about reducing construction emissions through resources like environmental product declarations and life-cycle assessment guidelines.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on practical steps for reducing embodied carbon in construction?",

Reducing heating-requirements of buildings is more important than the actual energy that goes into the building.   \n2. Build slow and reduce waste. Large construction firms waste tremendous amounts of materials and energy. Instead learn from the amish or similar cobuilding initiatives.  \n3. Right type of buildings. Don't build huge steel/concrete highrises when you can make 3-4 story apartment buildings completely out of wood and with reclaimed or local materials.  \n4. Build housing with and for the people. Banks should require proof of use or tenants signed up before giving any credit or loans to developers. Today lots of buildings are pure investments that stand empty most of the time.   \n5. Provide more than just housing. Like [sharphill.org](http://sharphill.org) that wants to build ecovillages with local agriculture and embedded co-ops to reduce commuting and share equity. It helps the climate, creates social justice and decentralization that better can endure eventual disasters/crisis."

I know the needed mix between wind and solar is dependant on location (I'm in WI). \n\nOur state utilities are asking to build several more natural gas plants because Microsoft is trying to build large data centers here and will need a ton of energy.\n\nAnyway, I was looking to see if there were any talking points about natural gas vs renewable so that I don't need to recreate the wheel. \n\nAlso I'm curious what other states have done to force more investment in renewable energy.
