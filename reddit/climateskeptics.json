                "Content": "More likely, she will appreciate her parents for instructing her so well in the art of the grift.\n\nWhen she and the rest of the world come to the realization that it was all BS, she will, internally, justify her stance by claiming that, after all, the scientists of the world *told* her that there was science behind it all. No personal responsibility is needed when the cause for her wrongness can be pawned off on someone else.\n\nMakes me think of the late '70s when I lived in Montreal. Around the campus of McGill University, I used to see graffiti such as \"A bas le Chah\" (English: \"down with the Shah\").  Not sure what it was like in the States but where I lived the Left was, like, 100% anti-Shah and pro-Iranian Revolution and, more significantly, pro-Khomeini.\n\nWell, some 40 years later, I can't imagine any Leftist supporting anything the current Iranian regime stands for (except perhaps their irrational anti-Israeli stance). And they are totally silent on their then utter support for the revolution and Khomeini.  If pressed, they'll say how evil the Shah was (sure, he wasn't a Saint by any means) but *zero* responsibility for supporting an evil that obviously was going to become something far, far worse.\n\nIn the same way, Greta and the rest of the world will realize at some point (maybe when she's 50 years old?) that the *catastrophic man-made climate change* narrative was all politicized science and there was nothing to do.  But it will be a cold day in hell when she says: I was wrong. Plus, the whole grift has made her rich beyond anything she or her family could have created via legitimate means. So there won't be any regretta's (pun intended) from her."

In 2024 DiCaprio used a 226 foot yacht classified as a supper yacht for his vacation getaway. \n\nHere is some information I found. \n\n\u201cOn average, smaller pleasure yachts with fuel capacities ranging from 200 to 1,000 gallons tend to be more fuel-efficient. They often feature modern technologies and hull designs optimized for reduced resistance and better fuel economy. As a rough estimate, these yachts can consume around 20 to 50 gallons of fuel per hour at cruising speed. Larger luxury yachts, such as superyachts and mega yachts with fuel capacities of 10,000 to 50,000 gallons, may have higher fuel consumption rates, averaging around 100 to 500 gallons per hour at cruising speed.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m doing what\u2019s popularly called homesteading. I only use about 50 gallons of diesel a year in my tractor that they are trying to regulate out of existence."

He could\u2019ve divorced her but he made his choice in life to stay. He knows he can\u2019t do shit to control her or the situation. Narcissists are just fucking crazy and extremely difficult to deal with. How do I know she\u2019s a crazy ass narcissist? Besides her fucking terrible behavior, a big clue is that flip to being a victim. Narcissists NEVER apologize for their words or behavior. They think they\u2019re always right"

Now, long-term tide gages, and recently satellite radars (NOT IMAGERY) are in agreement here that the rate is about \\~3mm globally. You can believe that this SLR is insignificant, or you can disagree with the data, idk what you believe. Regardless, 'potential risks' are not unfounded, as I work in coastal flooding, so an increase of 0.5m would increase the chance of low-lying areas and important assets getting flooded- some areas are only 3m above sea level, so SLR with high tides or waves can be significant. Look up nuisance flooding as a simple example. Also I work with sea grasses which are very sensitive to water depth, and 0.5m will impact to their already small habitable area. Develop an understanding of nuisance flooding or sea grass ecosystems before commenting further because straight dismissal is not helpful. \n\nI don't care what Al Gore is saying so that is not relevant. I've already agreed that it was alarmist.\n\nAgain I've outlined why 30 meter resolution satellite images are NOT useful to measure 16cm of SLR. Coming back to that point doesn't support anything, and before you do please look into different satellite instruments and their uses. \n\nThere are more credible predictions of future sea levels or climate predictions and less credible ones. People will use less credible predictions because they are alarmist and get more media/public attention, but that doesn't make it credible. There are plenty of scientists that use more conservative SLR predictions, but they don't get the media attention. So your understanding of climate change is biased due to media and politics, which is a huge issue and not your fault. I have deep qualms with the state of science regarding this matter.\n\nLol not a whack job, but appreciate the name calling, really says a lot about me wasting my time with you. I'm not the one thinking using satellite imagery is SLR gotcha, so I hope you at least acknowledge this oversight before you continue looking like a fool. \n\nMy take on climate change is very nuanced, I'm sorry you can't appreciate that. I'm very against climate alarmism, but do see value in a changing public perception to protect natural resources given the history of their recent destruction. There are many other elements of climate change and alarmism that I'm very against. As a reminder, this sub has members from a wide range of beliefs of climate change and its cause, and for open discussions and not name calling. Sorry for the wall if it is too much to take in."

SLR over 40 years can't be observed along the coast from satellites at 30m resolution. The primary cause of coastline change over the past 40 years is due to sediment supply for most areas. In other words, 0.4m SLR with a coastline slope of 0.2 would be 2m of horizontal migration - as an example that 30m satellite imagery isn't useful for this analysis. This doesn't account for the multitude of other factors that are in play along the coast. \n\nI would recommend you look at monthly mean sea levels such as here if you're curious about SLR:\n\n[https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends\\_station.shtml?id=9414290](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=9414290)\n\nWe'll see if this rate increases, but even after 100 yrs, it likely won't be visible from satellites on most shorelines, but can be detrimental in regions where ecosystems and coastlines cannot migrate. For example, my concern is for sea grass ecosystems, where 0.5m SLR reduces potential habitat space. Overall, the bigger issue is developed coastlines preventing natural coastline response to oceanographic conditions or sea level changes. \n\nI also see you linking Al Gore's take, which is \\~2 decades old and was even alarmist at the time."

In the early 1970s he was Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and then became the first executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme. He returned to Canada to become Chief Executive Officer of Petro-Canada from 1976 to 1978.\n\n>He served as a commissioner of the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1986[7] and was unironically recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a leader in the international environmental movement.[8]\n\nhttps://spectator.org/rockefeller-dream-the-truth-behind-climate-change/\n\n>In both cases the dire warnings were just useful lies, as the Club of Rome openly admitted in 1991 [in a book titled The First Global Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/FIRST-GLOBAL-REVOLUTION-Alexander-King/dp/0679738258), co-authored by co-founder Alexander King.  In the intro to Part II, he quoted French futurist Gaston Berger: \u201cWe must no longer wait for tomorrow; it has to be invented.\u201d So invent they did: King noted that the end of the Cold War resulted in the sudden absence of traditional enemies against which support for global government could be justified. He wrote, \u201cIn searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that \u2026 the threat of global warming \u2026 would fit the bill.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/maurice-strong-an-appreciation/\n\n>He was a great visionary, always ahead of our times in his thinking.

The Greenland ice cap is even thicker at around 1.4 miles thick.  \n\nThe arctic sea ice is a very different story.  More like 6-15 feet thick.  That ice is steadily melting and the loss of albedo has a big impact on the amount of sunlight absorbed vs. reflected.  The ice reflects about 90% which it means it only absorbs 10% of sunlight.  \n\nOpen water - very different story.  It only reflect 6% - which means it absorbs 94% of the sunlight.  That is why the ice is steadily melting.  We've already lost about 3 million KM\\^2 of sea ice - during the summers and that is a lot of heat getting absorbed that was previously reflected.

I'm guessing this is an example of an interesting spike in arctic temps/water temps.  \n\nThank you for sharing.  \n\nI do think it is worth mentioning that the big picture is indeed the Northwest passage.  Amundson was the first explorer to make it on water in 1906, but it took him 3 years.  McClure did it 50 years earlier - but part of his trip was by sledge over ice so it doesn't really count.  \n\nI mention this because the NW passage has been commercially un-viable for centuries, well it was up until now.  I believe that at the present, the commercial vessels (cargo) transiting the passage are \"ice strengthened\", but this isn't the reason they can transit.  Hull technology isn't the determinant as ice breakers have been around for a long time.  \n\nA quick bit on the feedback loop:  Bare (no snow) sea ice has an albedo of 60 percent (give or take).  Snow covered sea ice has an albedo of 85-90 percent.  Let's take a simple average of the two - 60% and 90% and say that sea ice reflects 75% of the light and absorbs 25%.  Open sea absorbs 94%.  As more sea ice melts,  the absorbed energy per square mile of Arctic ocean almost quadruples.  The year to year data is noisy, but if you average the coverage for decadal periods, the direction is strongly downward - 13% loss/decade.\n\nOther side of the world:\n\nFrom '79-2014 the Antarctic sea ice was growing at an average of 1% per decade - but from 2015 to the present, that trend reversed.  If you hide all and then turn on the decade of the 80's - and then click on 2012 forward, you will see a striking downward trend.      \n\n[https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/seaice\\_daily/](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/seaice_daily/)  \n\n\n\n**Commercial shipping in 2023**\n\nIn 2023, 22 large commercial vessels made 24 transits of the NWP, which was a 40% increase from the previous year"

Homelessness is a top example.  You can build all the housing you want.  You can pay for hotel rooms.  But if the majority of \"homeless\" people have mental issues are addicted to drugs or both then we are all wasting our time and tax money"

As an amateur meteorologist, there is so much disinformation out there claiming that climate change is the number one source of the world\u2019s problems, both ecologically and otherwise.  Many people aren\u2019t capable of critical thinking, and have no interest in science, and how weather actually works.  This applies to both alarmists and deniers.  Always be skeptical of any narrative.  A warming world will not kill off life as we know it.  Life will adapt and survive.  Trends may change.  Some areas will thrive.  Little wonder why Kamala never mentioned the taxes and restrictions that would be implemented if she had won, all for the war against undesirable weather."

If you claim that calc was wrong, you have to also acknowledge his co2 calc was wrong. If you accept his co2 calc, you have to accept his temp calc..... Because his co2 calc is based on a surface temp of 288K (bottom of pg 262 of below Arrhenius link)\n\n[https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896\\_tcm18-173546.pdf](https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf)\n\nAfter that paper, Ekholm wrote a paper in 1901, calculating the surface temp being 15.1C\n\n[https://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE\\_ClassicArticles/archives/classic\\_articles/issue1\\_global\\_warming/n5.\\_Ekholm\\_\\_1901.pdf](https://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE_ClassicArticles/archives/classic_articles/issue1_global_warming/n5._Ekholm__1901.pdf)\n\nNow heres the crux, Arrhenius was calculating that co2 would increase atmospheric temp as co2 was increased, and used 15C/288K as the basis of that calc - and today, the surface temp is observed/calc'd to be the same, ie 15C. \n\nAnd yet we're told that the 'pre-industrial period' (from 1850-1900) the surface temp was supposed to be around 13.7C - so that the warming since then has been 1.3C. But  where does the idea that the 1890's were  cooler than today come from? - tree ring and coral rings data and climate models that ASSUME the past was cooler, and because they ASSUME co2 causes warming - therefore if today is 15C, the past must be cooler.....ie the climate models hindcast temps. And as per YOUR quoted paper - they are wrong.\n\nSo if co2 is causing warming, why has the surface temp not changed in 128yrs? and why were Arrhenius' calcs wrong? - we've had a 50% increase in co2 since 1896 (280ppm) and temp is still the same?"

In a paper from 1906 iirc Arrhnenius writes that he assumes that the ground temperature is equal to the SAT. Nobody measures the ground temperature.\n\nHapper makes something similiar on page 8: [*We assume that the Earth has come to complete thermal equilibrium with an absolute surface temperature*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00808), there are several more assumptions, like: *We assume the Earth is a perfect \u201cblackbody\u201d for both sunlight and thermal radiation, in the sense that the surface absorbs all radiation incident on it, irrespective of the frequency or direction of the incident light.*\n\nIf you read further it looks like Happer is a little confused, he mentions pressure, the barometric formula, the standard atmosphere and more. Once again we can see there's [no defined \"greenhouse\" effect](https://osf.io/j7y8v/download/?format=pdf).\n\n> In 36 years the CAGW proponents have not been able to come up with a GHE idea and stick\nwith it.

They start with 1. When you falsify that they move to 2, then to 3 then to 4.\nWhen you falsify 4 they move back to 1 again. All the GHE ideas that have been put forward\nfail experiment and have been falsified in many different ways. The CAGW proponents have\nto keep changing them because they can\u2019t validate any of them in an experiment."

You add more, you get more warming, and we have the data to show it. Read the IPCC reports, it's all there in black and white. It blows my mind that this is even disputed in the 21st century.\u00a0"

When discussing climate change you talk about anomalies.\n\nThere has not been straight line warming since preindustrial times as the forcing from co2 until the last 50 years or so has not dominated natural effects. It does now and that is why the temperature is going up and accelerating. \n\nCO2 has a logarithmic relationship with temperature not linear. However, co2 levels have been growing exponentially so temperature increase is actually accelerating. \n\nWhy do you care about tree ring temperature proxies over a period when there are thermometers?\n\nRight from your source:\n\n> The rate of global sea level rise is accelerating: it has more than doubled from 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) per year throughout most of the twentieth century to 0.14 inches (3.6 millimeters) per year from 2006\u20132015. \n\nSea level is measured from satellites and coastal data. This year the sea level change was 4.0 mm per year. Sea level rise is accelerating because the global temperature is accelerating. \n\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/?intent=121"

So people can listen to her sing to them in person instead of on Spotify, YouTube, etc.\n\nTo be clear, I don't fault her for touring and fault her fans for wanting to go. I fault them for doing so AND preaching about the climate and environmentalism. As well as fault those that will scold me for not wanting to sacrifice my own moderate quality of life while turning a blind eye to this. I'm supposed to spend a ton of money on a shitty new electric car with limited range that decreases over time and massively inconveniences me with long charging times (compared to gassing up), but you won't even MENTION Swift's private jet and world tour or try to get such luxuries regulated to the extent you'd regulate me into an electric car? Fuck off. If the climate is such an existential threat, why would you do so much to contribute to the damage for something that is 100% purely luxury and entertainment?

Firstly, it causes the water to sublimate into water vapor that rises and becomes clouds, which reflect the sun's heat. \n\nAs a SCUBA diver, I have seen how quickly the sun's light falls off as you descend. Red light is nearly non existent beyond 20 feet. Green and blue light goes much deeper, which is why the ocean looks sorta blue green.\n\nI would imagine the ocean bottom at the equator might be a little warmer than it is at the poles, but I don't think it's a huge difference. The depths are COLD. Diving off south Florida in the summertime, surface temperature water would be in the 80s. At 50 feet it'd be in the 60s and getting colder the deeper you go."

In an opinion column titled \u201cFive Lies About Tobacco,\u201d Bast once repeatedly claimed that health concerns regarding cigarette smoking were overblown and worth ignoring. At first, Bast denied that he had ever dismissed concerns about smoking and disputed the quote we read to him.\n\n>\u201dIn 1998, you wrote in a Heartland op-ed that smoking cigarettes has little to no adverse health effects,\u201d we noted. \u201cDo you stand by that?\u201d\n\n>\u201dNo, I never wrote that,\u201d replied Bast. \u201cWhy would I have written something like that?\u201d Bast asked to see the op-ed, and promised to \u201ccontest\u201d it.\n\n>Later, Republic Report returned and read Bast\u2019s op-ed to him. Watch the video below:\n\n>After reading his op-ed to him \u2014 which claimed moderate smoking is not deadly and has \u201cfew, if any adverse health effects\u201d \u2014 Bast then reaffirmed his comments, but hedged, arguing that he meant \u201cone or two cigarettes a day or week.\u201d We read another line from his piece, which at the time claimed up to seven cigarettes a day does not raise the risk of lung cancer. Bast again confirmed his sentiment.\n\n>Heartland has gone to great lengths to argue that its attacks on public health or climate science are not motivated by the vast amounts of funding it receives from industry groups. But again, the tobacco wars are an instructive reminder of Heartland\u2019s agenda.\n\nhttps://www.prwatch.org/news/2014/05/12464/heartland-institute-reluctantly-stands-denial-cigarette-smoking-risks"

Last year it was second only to France, and the year before that it topped the EU league for dismantling them.\n\nReuters claims a debunk https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/map-shows-existing-river-barriers-not-dams-removed-before-deadly-valencia-floods-2024-11-11/\n\nIMO this mirrors the EU ecobureaucrat fiasco of recent decades of not dredging rivers, in the name of making Nature happy, rivers that had been dredged in prior centuries, then with less space in the rivers meant more flooding, more citizens lives damaged. More broadly it mirrors many dilettantish things Western govts have been doing.  \n\nI am not sure about the dams. But I do know the same people first went after CO2 . then methane, then nitrogen,and now dams.. these ecowarrior bureaucrats are nasty & stupid and they are something betwen dreamers and religious nuts.\n\nbtw in related news the science-less  editor of \"scientific american\" has been forced to resign. Her whole career is something to study..."

                "Content": "> A sensational science paper has blown holes in alarmist claims that global temperatures are surging. Just published results in Nature show \u201climited evidence\u201d for a warming surge. \u201cIn most surface temperature time series, no change in the warming rate beyond the 1970s is detected despite the breaking record temperatures observed in 2023,\u201d the paper says. \n\n> Written by an international group of mathematicians and scientists, it is unlikely to be acknowledged in the mainstream media where general hysteria reigns over the anomalous 2023 experience. As we have seen, constant misinformation is published to scare the general public and this is exemplified by climate comedy-turn Jim \u2018jail the deniers\u2019 Dale forecasting almost daily Armageddon and exhorting people to \u201cjoin up the dots\u201d.\n\n> The paper is highly technical and mathematically-inclined readers can study the full workings out in the open access publication. It notes that global temperature datasets fluctuate due to short-term variability and this often creates the appearance of surges and slowdowns in warming. It is important to consider random noise caused by natural variation when investigating the recent pauses in temperature and the more recent \u201calleged warming acceleration\u201d, it adds. \n\n> In fact there have been a number of plausible explanations given for the recent spike, with attention focused on the massive Hunga Tonga submarine volcano adding 13% extra water vapour to the stratosphere, a strong El Ni\u00f1o and even the reduction in atmospheric particulates caused by recent changes in shipping vessel fuel. Several \u201cchangepoints\u201d were used by the mathematicians and it was found that \u201ca warming surge could not be reliably detected any time after 1970\u201d.\n\n> Cliff Mass is the Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Washington. He has a golden rule of weather extremes: \u201cThe more extreme a climate or weather record is, the greater the contribution of natural variability, and the smaller the contribution of human-caused global warming.\u201d"

Still, we should all note that everywhere is \"ecologically-sensitive.\" The objective math is always difficult because we tend to favor environments with big mammals or struggle emotionally with the potential loss of endangered species, distracting us from big picture ecology (the ocean is a great example, overfishing, pollution).\n\nEvery type of energy generation has an impact. Compact energy sources have a smaller footprint and are dispatchable. Renewables have a large footprint, are intermittent, and are mining intensive. Frankly, the left's climate solutions are loony and expensive, and if everyone adopted your more pragmatic stance, we could strip away some of the divisive politics and serve multiple agendas. Unfortunately, environmental extremists are successfully driving the narrative through raw emotional appeal. Isn't it about time we reject that? I mean, we have a robust regulatory framework, what is the real danger?\n\nNatural gas for the short term, nuclear for the win, with an optimistic eye toward emerging tech."

Few working Americans can privilege long-term concern for the planet as a whole over concern about paying monthly bills for their home. Any legislation that increases net costs of energy ripples outward to increase the cost of living overall. My own support for climate progress is much more in the direction of cost-effective sustainable energy development and efficiency-incentives over stopping or even limiting oil and gas from anywhere with an already well-developed petroleum industry (the question of drilling in wilderness and ecologically-sensitive *new* sites is a different story in my book, but that's probably largely because I'm a middle class tree hugger...)"

Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world.\n\n> The document predicts that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents.\n\n[Climate Doomsday: Gulf Stream on the Verge of Collapse, Triggering a New Ice Age, Experts Warn](https://automagazine.pt/climate-doomsday-gulf-stream-on-the-verge-of-collapse-triggering-a-new-ice-age-experts-warn/)\n\n> The scientists warn that the AMOC\u2019s failure, which could occur as early as 2025, would result in catastrophic climate shifts, including the freezing of Europe, severe droughts, and sea-level rise along the U.S. East Coast. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that the AMOC is unlikely to collapse before 2100, these experts argue the threat has been drastically underestimated and urgent action is needed to prevent a global climate disaster.\n\n> This grim scenario echoes the plot of the 2004 disaster film The Day After Tomorrow, but scientists say the threat is now all too real. As the global temperature rises, melting ice is disrupting the deep-water formation that powers the Gulf Stream, leading to the possibility of a breakdown in the vital current that helps regulate weather patterns across the globe.\n\n> In addition to the freezing of Europe, a collapse could shift the tropical rainfall belt, leading to widespread droughts, famine, and a potential refugee crisis. Experts are calling on global leaders to take immediate action to mitigate the effects and avert a potential climate catastrophe that could last for centuries."

                "Content": "Your comment is based on a very common confusion brought about by climate alarmists Misinforming you about what climate skeptics believe.\n\nClearly, you think that climate skeptics do not think that there is global warming. Which is why you think your reference to calculus proves us wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to advise you that climate skeptics simply believe that man-made activity is not responsible for whatever global warming that actually exists, and we also believe that the science is publicly spun and misrepresented to blame human activity.\n\nThe idea that there is global warming of some amount is not contested although there might be arguments over the accuracy of the amount of warming as it is understood publicly.\n\nIt is also important to understand that the mainstream claim of climate activists is not that it is just natural global warming, but that human beings are causing the global warming by emitting more carbon dioxide.\n\nIt is common knowledge to everyone here, but perhaps not to you that since the 70s human carbon emissions are increasing rapidly every decade.\n\nThe evidence that since the 70s the rate of warming has not increased, contradicts the claim that it is our carbon dioxide use that is the cause of the warming, \n\nThat is because we produce more and more carbon dioxide every year, if we were responsible for driving the warming we should\u2019ve seen an increase in the rate of warming. \n\nThis influence could be represented by the second order derivative d2T/dt2, and clearly this latest study indicates that this is zero. \n\nThe fact that the rate of warming remains constant discredits the claims of climate change activists.\n\nSo therefore you are correct when you say that the title proves global warming, which has never been in question by climate skeptics, but it disproves man-made global warming due to carbon emissions which is what climate skeptics care about.\n\nAnd just the final point. It is clear that when many people say global warming, what they really mean is man-made global warming due to carbon emissions, I suggest you start forcing the distinction in order to avoid this type of confusion in the future."

Growth was then resumed, although there was a temporary downturn around 2022. These variations, which can also be observed before 1979, were caused by a number of natural atmospheric and oceanic factors."

So much for the settled science.\n\nThe trick with the 1.5\u00b0C is that they're telling the people the optimum temperature is dangerous, that a colder planet will have \"less climate extremes\" aka severe weather."

The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming \u2013 leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.\u2019 \n\n> No doubt in BBC-world they actually believe that polar bears are dying out. It is, after all, an article of faith for the global warming cult. However, far from declining, the world\u2019s population of polar bears has tripled since the 1960s, thanks to the ban on hunting in 1973."

This is encouraging.\u00a0\n\nThis is not only happening with coal; Blackrock has publicly ostracized Big Oil, but has also invested in these companies. Exxon and Chevron are sitting on billions of barrels of oil (which can be sold @ $68/barrel) and benefit from an increase in price due to governments making it harder to drill for oil. Blackrock and Vanguard reap the benefits.\n\nFrom OP\u2019s article:\nFinally, a strike at the heart of the Blob\nTexas and 10 other US States have pressed\u00a0the radioactive Antitrust legal button and\u00a0filed against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The states claim the money managers bought up large stakes in coal companies and then colluded to promote ESG and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) goals that reduced coal output. The decreased supply of coal, in turn increased the cost of electricity to consumers. It was fundamentally anti-competitive behaviour. These three companies together have $26 Trillion dollars of assets under management. That\u2019s only one trillion smaller than the entire US GDP.\n\nIn this case, some of the collusion hidden in clear view. The three money managers said they were trying to save the world and to protect the people, and they joined groups like the GFANZ and Net Zero alliances like Climate Action 100+. But in the end, these three financial giants had collectively acquired close to 30% of most US Coal companies, and even though they claimed to have good intentions, the 11 State Attorney Generals argue that any extraneous claims of social benefits are irrelevant. These three companies have profited immensely while customers have been denied access to a free and open market, and have paid higher electricity bills.\n\nIn a democracy, the people are supposed to decide the policies, not the Oligarchs."

I just want to be left alone and believe in laissez faire, while the WEF/Democrat/neoliberal crowd is pushing a very authoritarian agenda, which is killing the middle and lower classes and Net Zeroing us all into poverty, without any experimental verification.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAbout the methodology. The first question asked is \u201cDo you believe in climate change\u201d. Apparently, they still managed to find 54% of participants to answer no, even though I would find myself in the \u201cyes\u201d category. This raises questions about the study design.\u00a0\n\nThe article has too many simple spelling errors. Connexion - connection. It had two authors. At least one of them has proofread it?

The Argentinian president is a denier of climate science and calls the environmental crisis a \u201csocialist lie\u201d.\n\n> At the General Assembly in September, Mr Milei criticised the UN for attempting to \"impose an ideological agenda\" and distanced Argentina from the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. \u201cWe are at the end of a cycle. The collectivism and moral high ground from the woke agenda have crashed with reality, and they don\u2019t offer credible solutions for the world\u2019s problems,\u201d he said."

We must state clearly that we use climate policy to redistribute de facto the world's wealth. Climate policy has almost nothing to do anymore with protecting the environment.

The NWO is a misnomer, there is nothing new about it. It is the return to the dark ages when the papacy ruled the world unopposed. It could take the shape of feudalism and it could be pure slavery like in North Korea, depending what is the agenda of the central planners clustered in pontifical academies and Jesuit universities.\n\nThe point is to eliminate even the theoretical possibility of disrupting the established power in perpetuity. The greatest minds, cutting edge science, every technology known to man is being continuously weaponized to widen the gap between us and them.\n\nYou see, communism was created not to free the masses, but to enslave them further.\n\nThat is why the green agendas are called watermelon communism.

Why not the 30 year period immediately preceding 2024?  Is it perhaps because the 1961-1990 data is particularly favorable for some point they want to make?\n\nThree, a 2 degree offset over the long term average could be significant, or it could be entirely normal.  Without knowing what the variance - the variability in the data is, for all we know being \"only\" 2 degrees above or below the average could be a relatively mild year.\n\nIn other words, without answers to these questions the observation of the 2 degree increase is utterly meaningless.

                "Content": "In the 1970s, the propaganda was \"global cooling.\" Now it's \"global warming.\" \n\nThis season is not that serious. This isn't the first time a hurricane went that far inland. This isn't the first time a state saw back to back major hurricanes. See 1900 when a hurricane leveled Galveston Island. See the dust bowl of the 1930s.  See 1993 when a bomb cyclone buried Appalachia in snow. See 2005 when Louisiana when they got hit with back to back hurricanes. See 2016 when West Virginia hollers drowned in 1000-year flooding. No one can say the propaganda was nearly as strong then as it is now. That isn't a coincidence.\n\nI've made this point in other subreddits. One problem is that plebians of progressive society don't know how to decifer raw data from \"data-based\" products. Most people, like you people, get your information from either propaganda or \"data-based\" products. \"Data-based\" products are things like the graphs and charts you find. Most people of progressive society misinterpret these products and use them as if they are raw data. Raw data gives you true values, like temps, densities, humidity, pressures, thicknesses, and so on. In meteorology, these values are always coded. It's the numeric value that a sensor records and sends to a database to be collected and referenced. However, now trained people (which usually work for a given government) have to decode those values to be applied in a presentation so that a given audience can understand them. Now, audiences range; that can be higher officers of the military conducting a military operation, or that can be simple-minded progressives or neo-cons that need to be influenced to accept a narrative. The products will be different, and only certain types of products are available depending on who you are.\n\nThe other problem is that most people don't know how to decifer true information from propaganda."

I know a bit about how the weather is recorded and reported. \n\n>Every single field of science and technology has improved its understanding of its field since the 1970s,\n\nYou are only agreeing with my point in a way. Just because our means of recording weather is developing does not mean the weather itself is changing in the way it is propagandized to appear. We have more means of observing every corner of society and nature than we did 100 years ago, just like the use and creation of propaganda has developed. So just because we have more information recorded now doesn't mean that the same or similar information wasn't already present in the distant past. With this kind of development, the benchmark is something unknowable because our means of recording back then was not as in-depth as it is now. But I just listed several instances that should prove that disastrous natural events are not new.\n\n>That's a very long winded way of trying to claim the reason you can't find any data that backs up your thesis \n\nWell I gotta try to explain as thoroughly as I can because you people aren't actually that smart. Like you missed my whole explanation separating \"data\" from \"products\". \"Products\" in this case are things prepared for the one who is proposed to digest what is presented, while \"data\" is where these products come from, which in meteorology, is *always* encoded. The thing is that there's no way to trust where the data comes from because of the second problem I explained: progressive society neither can't or won't decifer propaganda from true information. \n\nHowever, never fear, the agenda of the establishment is working. You people get to go along with everything the state-owned media puts in front of you, and life is easier for the duration of your attention span."

We know we are in the middle of an interglacial period so we would assume sea ice loss and minor warming.\n\nThe argument and implications is that it's man made and happzaening fa555ster.  There is no proof of that.\n\nWe also dont have enough data to really see what the natural swings are like but clearly natural swings play a big role.  There is accounts of boats have access to places we can't access right now pre 1980, so again we really don't have enough data.\n\nThe variation levels are not overly big so we can't really say what's normal.\n\nIf you compare the total ice lost including sea ice it's so fractional that you can't see it on a graph.\n\nSea ice doesn't effect sea level.\n\nSo anyone making any conclusions is deluded.  And we have many such predictions including those published by the ipcc that are clearly wrong.\n\nThen we have the antartic land ice stability especially in the last 20 years as well as.\n\nWe get constant fear mongering yet the reality is the state of total is is incredibly stable and sea level rise is not accelerating.  Even if it was it would need to speed up 10x more before humans would have to make an effort to combat it."

No one denies that CO2 is crucial in maintaining the Earth's habitable climate. However, the question isn\u2019t whether CO2 is important, it clearly is, but whether the incremental increase in anthropogenic CO2 is enough to drive a \"crisis\" in a highly complex, multivariate climate system.\n\nWhile pre-industrial CO2 levels of 280 ppm were vital, the argument I\u2019m making is about the relative scale of anthropogenic contributions (approximately 0.0016% of the atmosphere). Climate models that predict catastrophic outcomes often assume feedback loops that amplify CO2's effect, but these feedbacks are highly uncertain and not universally agreed upon in the scientific community.\n\nThe debate isn\u2019t about the importance of CO2 in general, it\u2019s about the extent to which human activity within that small fraction significantly impacts the system compared to natural variability. Climate science is nuanced, and conclusions should be grounded in both historical context and robust empirical evidence."

The Scripts datasets, which includes Moana Loa, can be found [here](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/graphics_gallery/mauna_loa_record/mauna_loa_record_color.html), as well as many other sources. Sometime during that year, CO2 exceeded 400 ppm (4/10,000). Pre-industrial levels can be found [here](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/03/met-office-atmospheric-co2-industrial-levels-environment-climate-change/). 278 ppm, at a time it could not be measured, is an estimate \u2026 call it 3/10,000. The difference, obviously is 1/10,000, as the post points out.\n\nRegarding the Anthroprogenic arguments, they are old \u2026 there must be more recent analysis of the 13CO2 data."

There can be nearby concentrated sources (our breath, or exhaust pipes), but the same concentrated sinks just don't exists, so levels don't go past a few ppm below background average levels. \n\nSo I'd say your household monitor is having some sort of technical error during periods of rain, as the 250 ppm reading just doesn't make physical sense, and isn't supported by other properly calibrated measurements."

This means they are beyond many household budgets and largely limited to people whose so-called carbon footprint is higher than the general population due to them having more money to spend.\n\n>In work published by the journal PLOS Climate, the researchers said \"electric vehicle owners on average are richer, drive more than the general population, and have a higher than average carbon footprint due to higher disposable income.\"\n\n...so in summary, electric cars good, but people with electric cars bad, cuz those people have too much money. There are only two solutions, get rid of the money...or the people.\n\n\n\n\n",

This is truly remarkable since manned powered flight was not achieved until 1903 and the actual airport was built in 1937. Yet another error in the Met Office\u2019s temperature recording database. Yet another sign that in its mission to scare the population into accepting the looming Net Zero catastrophe, the Met Office is failing in its day job to accurately record temperatures across the U.K. Over the last year there have been revelations about data invention at [103 non-existent weather stations](https://dailysceptic.org/2024/11/05/science-shock-u-k-met-office-is-inventing-temperature-data-from-100-non-existent-stations/) while almost the entire 380-strong network is heavily skewed by unnatural heat corruptions. \n\n> All of this in a year when it added a [politicised measure](https://climate.metoffice.cloud/current_warming.html) to its \u201cIndicators of Global Warming\u201d based on just 10 years of actual data and 10 years of computer model speculations loaded with improbable claims of future temperature rises."

                "Content": "> the idea that wind stops at night everywhere - which seems to be what he's implying - is fallacy. \n\n[Cold without wind: German \u2018dunkelflaute\u2019 brings electricity prices to crisis levels and depletes gas reserves](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-12-12/cold-without-wind-german-dunkelflaute-brings-electricity-prices-to-crisis-levels-and-depletes-gas-reserves.html)\n\n> Dunkelflaute is a cursed word in the German electricity sector. The combination, typical of cold anticyclones, of low temperatures (which increase demand) and the almost total absence of wind (which hinders wind generation) configures one of the worst possible scenarios for the price of electricity: it forces the burning of more gas in combined cycle plants, which are much more expensive, and that substantially increases the bill. This dreaded cocktail, which is currently hitting Central Europe, is leading the price of electricity in Europe\u2019s largest economy to levels not seen since the energy crisis.\n\n[Sweden Blasts Germany For Rising Electricity Prices](https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/sweden-blasts-germany-for-rising-electricity-prices-88720)\n\n> Germany's recent power issues stemmed from what has been described as \"Dunkelflaute,\" where neither wind nor solar power can meet demand. This led to energy prices soaring after the country experienced low renewable output. Busch noted, \"Because of exports of power to Germany when prices rise, supply decreases here too, leading to increased prices for Swedish consumers.\"\n\n> Germany and Sweden\u2019s discussions are underscored by the broader European dilemma of energy dependency, particularly as member states work through limiting fossil fuel use against rising market demands. The intertwined situations of various countries are now highlighting the vulnerabilities within the energy market and exposing weaknesses of diversified sources."

There is a time and place.\n\nMy biggest argument against renewables is, even if the wind stops blowing for just one day a year, there needs to be a whole backup system sitting there not used for the other 364 days of the year to cover the shortfall. That's wasteful, expensive, inefficient. Those gas turbines need to be sitting on idle ready to go. The system needs to be overbuilt to compensate.\n\nSure batteries, pumped hydro, etc can rectify this to a degree, but these are also expensive, environmental impact, two systems need to be maintained, dams, water turbines, batteies, etc.\n\nIf the wind never stopped, I'd be all for the wind to be part of the energy mix."

The video is a cut-down version of a much longer discussion and therefore lacks some context.\n\nWhat the speaker is implying is wind and solar are only available for a fraction of each day. That might vary, but it's typically only 20%. However, as you've pointed out, there are places where availability is more than that. But I'm sure wind turbines do not operate 100% of the time anywhere, even the place you mentioned. \n\nAlso wind turbines require a steady wind between \\~43 km/h  to \\~80 km/h to operate. This further reduces their operating availability."

There was a plan to build massive solar panels in the middle of Australia and sell it to Indonesia and the Phillipines but a dust storm wrecked it before it was completed. I am in the west and the bulk of our electricity comes from Muja and Collie that were coal plants and have been converted to natural gas which the state has an abundance of. One coal plant is still running called Bluewater and is only 10 years old so will go for another 50 years. I just did a 3000 km trip north to Karratha and back to see my brother in pt Samson and go fishing. I noticed most roadhouses had solar and it works brilliantly. The generator set at Overlander was not even running. I am a big fan of wind and solar in the right places it just will not supply the entire planet. The East coast has no gas reserves and is still mostly coal fired. The west could send gas but they do not have unloading facilities yet. Renewable energy is quaint but unreliable"

This helps to control floods. \u00a0\n\nThe buffer capacity is reduced when dams are removed, similar to how the buffer capacity is reduced when trees are cut, beaver dams are removed and other vegetation is cut. Remember erosion from your primary school text books?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If you do not believe dams help to reduce flooding, be my guest and start cutting trees and vegetation in mountainous areas.

Probably difficult to tell, because you would only measure in case you suspect there is narrowing. There is not a before and after measurement. But if the vessel is blocked (worst case), the flow is zero. Common sense says a blockage, or a valve (\u2026 or a dam) leads to less flow."

Let\u2019s take a tight aortic valve as an example and you are doing a cardiac \u201cecho\u201d on it.\n\nYou aim a high frequency sound wave along the direction of blood flow through the aortic valve you are examining with an ultrasound probe on the chest.\n\nThe sound waves bounce off the moving red cells. Just like your voice echoing off a cliff face. Except the red cells are moving so the frequency of the returning sound way changes. Just like the sound changes when ambulance siren comes towards you and then away from you. The probe listens for this return echo with this changed frequency and measures the Doppler shift.\u00a0 The degree of Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the moving red cells.\u00a0 The velocity is plotted against time. It looks like an upside down parabola.\u00a0The peak velocity can be measured.\u00a0\n\nUsing a modified Bernoulli equation ( pressure change = 4V squared) which is based on a number of assumption, it\u2019s easy to calculate the peak pressure gradient across the valve.\u00a0\n\nThere are more complicated calc to determine the mean gradient and the actual area of the narrowing.\n\nThese numbers quantify the severity of the narrowing which is used to plan when surgery is needed.\u00a0"

As they might say in Main Street U.S.A., \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s watch.\n\n> Indeed, among Mr. Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters will likely be the host of COP29, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, who described his country\u2019s oil and gas resources as \u201ca gift from God\u201d.

A frequency that CO2 can now absorb. CO2 absorbs that heat energy and release it. Some of that released energy heads\u00a0out into space but some heads back down towards earth.\u00a0\n\nThe visible and infrared enter the atmosphere, heating the surface. The heated surface emits black body radiation with a maximum at a wavelength of 15 micrometer, exactly the wavelength where CO2 is a *perfect* absorber.\n\nIt absorbs all of the energy. Nothing makes it to space. Only a little bit of CO2 is needed to make this happen. Adding more CO2 is not going to make less radiation at 15 micrometer reach space, because it is all absorbed already.\n\nEarlier, Hanssen er al insisted 50% of the energy was returned through emitted photons (radiation) back to earth. This is incorrect, because the absorbed radiation is dissipated through collisions with neighboring gas molecules, warming the air. But nothing in this process changes by adding more CO2.\n\nThe problem here for alarmists is that CO2 is a perfect greenhouse gas.. For their story to work, a *weak* greenhouse gas would have made more sense. A gas which absorbs 10% of all radiation emitted towards space. In this case, doubling its concentration would double the absorption, causing more warming (of the air). It then would still be a question whether the warming would lead to any warming we could experience, or any warming of the air, which would improve convection -> which incidentally improves cooling."

                "Content": "It is not easy, because the underlying physics are complex and interdisciplinary, meaning there are only a few people who have a full overview to understand the relationship between higher concentrations of CO2 and warming.\n\nThis perhaps explains why 97% of climate scientists believe in man made climate change, because they read newspapers. They cannot all fully understand the problem, because they are not all multidisciplinary scientists.\n\nFor instance, without a thorough understanding of spectroscopy, there is no point in trying to figure this out. But spectroscopy experts often have zero practical experience with thermodynamics or fluid mechanics. They see spectra everywhere, but don\u2019t understand adiabatic processes.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, our universities have put so much attention to the theory (which is easiest to teach) and almost no effort in teaching students how to properly do science. Out of 1000 students, there are a handful of BPhil students and PhD students who will have the opportunity to properly do science, but even in this group, ~50% prefer to do politics or marketing to advance their careers over doing thorough science. Science requires common sense, and common sense is spread thin.\n\nThen there is the cognitive bias: if you expect a causal relationship between increased levels of CO2 and rising temperatures, you will find it. This is how our brain works. A good example is Sabine Hossenfelder, who is a good scientist, but who has bought into the concept of CO2 induced warming and can no longer see the forrest for the trees.\n\nWe have already mentioned the bias induced by grant agencies and the publishing system, both promoting science which fits the warming narrative and ruining the careers of those who do not toe the warming line.\u00a0"

Instead we find that with the increase of co2, theres more energy being radiated. its almost like the biosphere is a self regulating system\n\n[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10712-024-09838-8.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10712-024-09838-8.pdf)\n\nthe above paper shows that there has been an increase in absorbed solar radiation, primarily observed in the oceans, and this is partially offset by an increase in OLR (when co2 emits radiant energy to space). Observed warming has therefore nothing to do with co2, as radiation emitted from co2 does not penetrate the ocean thermal skin layer - see:\n\n[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JC013351](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JC013351)"

                "Content": "> Notably, there remains an unexplained gap of about 0.2\u00b0C in the global temperature rise. A team from the Alfred Wegener Institute proposes a compelling hypothesis: the Earth\u2019s surface has become less reflective due to a decline in certain types of clouds. This reduction in reflectivity may help explain the additional warming\n\n> \u201cIn addition to the influence of El Ni\u00f1o and the expected long-term warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases, several other factors have already been discussed that could have contributed to the surprisingly high global mean temperatures since 2023,\u201d says Dr Helge Goessling, main author of the study from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI): e.g. increased solar activity, large amounts of water vapor from a volcanic eruption, or fewer aerosol particles in the atmosphere. But if all these factors are combined, there is still 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming with no readily apparent cause.\u201c\n\n> The 0.2-degree-Celsius \u2018explanation gap\u2019 for 2023 is currently one of the most intensely discussed questions in climate research,\u201d says Helge Goessling. In an effort to close that gap, climate modelers from the AWI and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) took a closer look at satellite data from NASA, as well as the ECMWF\u2019s own reanalysis data, in which a range of observational data is combined with a complex weather model. In some cases, the data goes back to 1940, permitting a detailed analysis of how the global energy budget and cloud cover at different altitudes have evolved.\n\nNow let them find out that the oceans are a humungous heat capacitor that is not warmed by the colder atmosphere. Someone needs to tell them. Oh, wait..."

I got a subscription recommendation, but was permitted to read the article. The author's bias was abundantly clear, though they tried to give a fair appraisal. The answer was much simpler than they concluded.\n\nKamala is a profoundly bad candidate. She came out of the 2020 primaries without a single delegate. Nobody wanted her to be President. The only reason she was coronated by Joe Biden is because there wasn't a lot of time left, and she was the only person who could inherit his campaign war chest since her name was also on the ticket. Most of the people who are voting for her now aren't doing so because they actually want her to be President, any more than they wanted her to be President in 2020. They're voting for her because they hate Trump, and would vote for a dead skunk if that was their only other option.\n\nBut the Trump-haters bandwagon is less than half of the voter base, as are the hard core Trump supporters. What's left is a fairly small number of undecided voters who neither hate nor like either candidate. There aren't enough voters in play for either one of them to \"run away with this\"."

They don't have a weather station every 1,000 yards in a grid across the earth. So they take two readings and then estimate the shit out of enormous huge swaths of various regions.\n\nYou may think that's scientifically possible, and you may even be right. But the problem is all of the people behind the wheel are OD'ing off the climate alarmism kool-aid that their biases are bleeding through into their data.\n\nSo what we end up with is hysteria getting it's hands on the pendulum and forcefully putting it somewhere that's at odds with what we can realistically expect the world to look like."

Alas, enjoy it only a little while longer since this story may have to be retired after putting in such a sterling propaganda shift. Global temperatures are falling like a stone, while the oceans are cooling at a remarkably rapid rate. \n\n> Land temperatures are also falling with the UAH satellite record recently showing some significant monthly falls. Except for satellites accurately measuring the atmosphere near the Earth, we must treat most land surface temperature numbers with caution if not cynicism given how much we have recently discovered about urban heat corruption, invented data, retrospective adjustments and scandalously lax station siting policies. Nevertheless, it would appear that land temperatures are starting to fall and cooler oceans will hasten this process."

The 12-year ENSO cycle identified by their wavelet analysis they attribute to underwater volcanic activity; it does not correspond to any solar cycle or other known natural source of warming.\n\n[Volcanic Eruptions and Solar Activity](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1989/1989_Stothers_st07500u.pdf)\n\n> The historical record of large volcanic eruptions from 1500 to 1980, as contained in two recent catalogs, is subjected to detailed time series analysis. Two weak, but probably statistically significant, periodicities of \u223c11 and \u223c80 years are detected. Both cycles appear to correlate with well-known cycles of solar activity; the phasing is such that the frequency of volcanic eruptions increases (decreases) slightly around the times of solar minimum (maximum). \n\n> The weak quasi-biennial solar cycle is not obviously seen in the eruption data, nor are the two slow lunar tidal cycles of 8.85 and 18.6 years. Time series analysis of the volcanogenic acidities in a deep ice core from Greenland, covering the years 553-1972, reveals several very long periods ranging from \u223c80 to \u223c350 years and are similar to the very slow solar cycles previously detected in auroral and carbon 14 records. \n\n> Solar flares are believed to cause changes in atmospheric circulation patterns that abruptly alter the earth's spin. The resulting jolt probably triggers small earthquakes which may temporarily relieve some of the stress in volcanic magma chambers, thereby weakening, postponing, or even aborting imminent large eruptions. In addition, decreased atmospheric precipitation around the years of solar maximum may cause a relative deficit of phreatomagmatic eruptions at those times."

There appears to be a general agreement that he would try to do the same during this term as well.\n\n**Exxon, however, has staked billions on the energy transition, especially in the carbon capture segment**. Last year, the company paid $5 billion for Denbury Resources, a carbon dioxide pipeline network operator. Besides that acquisition, Exxon has also recently signed three more deals for carbon capture and storage, one with CF Industries, one with industrial gas makers Linde, and one with steelmaker Nucor. Earlier this year Exxon also said it had teamed up with Shell to develop carbon capture and storage solutions for Singapore.\n\nCarbon capture and storage is the obvious choice for many oil producers who want to reduce their carbon footprint\u2014or help others reduce theirs. Investment, however, needs to expand considerably under net-zero scenarios.\n\nWith a view to all these investments already made, it really would be uncertainty-inducing if Trump lifts the Paris Agreement obligation for companies to reduce their emissions. However, it does not mean he would ban them from reducing their emissions in any way they see fit, including through carbon capture.\n\nBy Irina Slav for [Oilprice.com](http://Oilprice.com) Nov 12, 2024, 2:01 AM CST",

The temperature reduction can be even more pronounced \u2013 from +1.43\u00b0C down to +0.41\u00b0C \u2013 if a set of conservative assumptions (described in detail in the paper) are removed.\n\n> Interestingly, when the systematically erroneous temperature data are removed, or homogenized, at different intervals of time (2 years vs. 12 to 30 years, etc.), the global temperature trend \u2013 indeed, the long-term global warming trend \u2013 can be shown to effectively disappear, depending on the time interval. This can be observed below, in Figure 7.\n\n> As this chart illustrates, temperature data can homogenized, or adjusted, to exhibit just about any trend or non-trend the creator of the chart intends to. Data can be bent and manipulated to show strong warming, weak warming, or even no warming over the last 140 years.\n\n> Perhaps the modern version of global warming is not nearly as unprecedented or even unusual as it is purported to be."
