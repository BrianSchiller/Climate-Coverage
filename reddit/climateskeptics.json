                "Content": "More likely, she will appreciate her parents for instructing her so well in the art of the grift.\n\nWhen she and the rest of the world come to the realization that it was all BS, she will, internally, justify her stance by claiming that, after all, the scientists of the world *told* her that there was science behind it all. No personal responsibility is needed when the cause for her wrongness can be pawned off on someone else.\n\nMakes me think of the late '70s when I lived in Montreal. Around the campus of McGill University, I used to see graffiti such as \"A bas le Chah\" (English: \"down with the Shah\").  Not sure what it was like in the States but where I lived the Left was, like, 100% anti-Shah and pro-Iranian Revolution and, more significantly, pro-Khomeini.\n\nWell, some 40 years later, I can't imagine any Leftist supporting anything the current Iranian regime stands for (except perhaps their irrational anti-Israeli stance). And they are totally silent on their then utter support for the revolution and Khomeini.  If pressed, they'll say how evil the Shah was (sure, he wasn't a Saint by any means) but *zero* responsibility for supporting an evil that obviously was going to become something far, far worse.\n\nIn the same way, Greta and the rest of the world will realize at some point (maybe when she's 50 years old?) that the *catastrophic man-made climate change* narrative was all politicized science and there was nothing to do.  But it will be a cold day in hell when she says: I was wrong. Plus, the whole grift has made her rich beyond anything she or her family could have created via legitimate means. So there won't be any regretta's (pun intended) from her."

In 2024 DiCaprio used a 226 foot yacht classified as a supper yacht for his vacation getaway. \n\nHere is some information I found. \n\n\u201cOn average, smaller pleasure yachts with fuel capacities ranging from 200 to 1,000 gallons tend to be more fuel-efficient. They often feature modern technologies and hull designs optimized for reduced resistance and better fuel economy. As a rough estimate, these yachts can consume around 20 to 50 gallons of fuel per hour at cruising speed. Larger luxury yachts, such as superyachts and mega yachts with fuel capacities of 10,000 to 50,000 gallons, may have higher fuel consumption rates, averaging around 100 to 500 gallons per hour at cruising speed.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m doing what\u2019s popularly called homesteading. I only use about 50 gallons of diesel a year in my tractor that they are trying to regulate out of existence."

See [CO2 Coalition](https://co2coalition.org).\n- The \u2018partial\u2019 group includes [Willie Soon\u2019s article](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/9/179) about the urban bias inherent in the IPCC models, concluding that\n>Meanwhile, we found that simply substituting an alternative solar forcing dataset to that considered by AR6\u2019s climate model hindcasts can substantially increase the amount of the 1850\u20132018 warming that can be explained in terms of natural forcing from 21% to 70% of the long-term warming implied by the \u201crural and urban\u201d series and 87% of the \u201crural-only\u201d temperature series.\n- The \u2018practically all\u2019 group is the IPCC.\n\nIn this group, we tend to poke fun at the latter, but amidst the memes and ridicule, there are legitimate posts to scientific studies, supporting the all or mostly natural point of view.\n\nThere is a 97% agreement that IPCC is wrong \u2026 OK, I made the statistic up, but my guess is it\u2019s accurate."

Now, long-term tide gages, and recently satellite radars (NOT IMAGERY) are in agreement here that the rate is about \\~3mm globally. You can believe that this SLR is insignificant, or you can disagree with the data, idk what you believe. Regardless, 'potential risks' are not unfounded, as I work in coastal flooding, so an increase of 0.5m would increase the chance of low-lying areas and important assets getting flooded- some areas are only 3m above sea level, so SLR with high tides or waves can be significant. Look up nuisance flooding as a simple example. Also I work with sea grasses which are very sensitive to water depth, and 0.5m will impact to their already small habitable area. Develop an understanding of nuisance flooding or sea grass ecosystems before commenting further because straight dismissal is not helpful. \n\nI don't care what Al Gore is saying so that is not relevant. I've already agreed that it was alarmist.\n\nAgain I've outlined why 30 meter resolution satellite images are NOT useful to measure 16cm of SLR. Coming back to that point doesn't support anything, and before you do please look into different satellite instruments and their uses. \n\nThere are more credible predictions of future sea levels or climate predictions and less credible ones. People will use less credible predictions because they are alarmist and get more media/public attention, but that doesn't make it credible. There are plenty of scientists that use more conservative SLR predictions, but they don't get the media attention. So your understanding of climate change is biased due to media and politics, which is a huge issue and not your fault. I have deep qualms with the state of science regarding this matter.\n\nLol not a whack job, but appreciate the name calling, really says a lot about me wasting my time with you. I'm not the one thinking using satellite imagery is SLR gotcha, so I hope you at least acknowledge this oversight before you continue looking like a fool. \n\nMy take on climate change is very nuanced, I'm sorry you can't appreciate that. I'm very against climate alarmism, but do see value in a changing public perception to protect natural resources given the history of their recent destruction. There are many other elements of climate change and alarmism that I'm very against. As a reminder, this sub has members from a wide range of beliefs of climate change and its cause, and for open discussions and not name calling. Sorry for the wall if it is too much to take in."

SLR over 40 years can't be observed along the coast from satellites at 30m resolution. The primary cause of coastline change over the past 40 years is due to sediment supply for most areas. In other words, 0.4m SLR with a coastline slope of 0.2 would be 2m of horizontal migration - as an example that 30m satellite imagery isn't useful for this analysis. This doesn't account for the multitude of other factors that are in play along the coast. \n\nI would recommend you look at monthly mean sea levels such as here if you're curious about SLR:\n\n[https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends\\_station.shtml?id=9414290](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=9414290)\n\nWe'll see if this rate increases, but even after 100 yrs, it likely won't be visible from satellites on most shorelines, but can be detrimental in regions where ecosystems and coastlines cannot migrate. For example, my concern is for sea grass ecosystems, where 0.5m SLR reduces potential habitat space. Overall, the bigger issue is developed coastlines preventing natural coastline response to oceanographic conditions or sea level changes. \n\nI also see you linking Al Gore's take, which is \\~2 decades old and was even alarmist at the time."

You don't know what you are talking about and try to make it about Trump, who gives a fuck about him?\n\n> John Tyndall\u2019s experiment doesn\u2019t count\n\nAre you sure his experiment was about the GHE? The dude had only made a primitive spectrometer. It's only yet another variation of the scam in this video https://youtu.be/rD2jnz_0MyA, they just show spectroscopy and assume everything else works. Since the warming of the GHE is found using the SB model, using a gas isn't even needed, and in fact the effect should be much more pronounced with a solid object instead of just \"Co2 gas\". Do you have a vaccuum experiment that shows your \"radiative heat transfer\" warming something with a GHE?"

Just like big tobacco hired their own scientists to produce results that they wanted. If you don\u2019t like the facts just make up your own. \n\nOPEC is there to create scarcity, it\u2019s a cartel. Trump is playing to his audience he\u2019s a politician. \n\nRadiative heat transfer does not necessarily warm something but it can slow the cooling because some of the IR emitted is returned. The earth is in space, which is cold, and CO2 sends some IR back to earth keeping it warmer than it would have been without it. Usually deniers of reality misstate what the premise is (ie saying warming something) so that their argument makes more sense. I am sure the 2LoT is about to be mentioned because that is where that false terminology comes from."

                "Content": "I truly believe this.  As an amateur meteorologist, there is so much disinformation out there claiming that climate change is the number one source of the world\u2019s problems, both ecologically and otherwise.  Many people aren\u2019t capable of critical thinking, and have no interest in science, and how weather actually works.  This applies to both alarmists and deniers.  Always be skeptical of any narrative.  A warming world will not kill off life as we know it.  Life will adapt and survive.  Trends may change.  Some areas will thrive.  Little wonder why Kamala never mentioned the taxes and restrictions that would be implemented if she had won, all for the war against undesirable weather."

If you claim that calc was wrong, you have to also acknowledge his co2 calc was wrong. If you accept his co2 calc, you have to accept his temp calc..... Because his co2 calc is based on a surface temp of 288K (bottom of pg 262 of below Arrhenius link)\n\n[https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896\\_tcm18-173546.pdf](https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf)\n\nAfter that paper, Ekholm wrote a paper in 1901, calculating the surface temp being 15.1C\n\n[https://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE\\_ClassicArticles/archives/classic\\_articles/issue1\\_global\\_warming/n5.\\_Ekholm\\_\\_1901.pdf](https://nsdl.library.cornell.edu/websites/wiki/index.php/PALE_ClassicArticles/archives/classic_articles/issue1_global_warming/n5._Ekholm__1901.pdf)\n\nNow heres the crux, Arrhenius was calculating that co2 would increase atmospheric temp as co2 was increased, and used 15C/288K as the basis of that calc - and today, the surface temp is observed/calc'd to be the same, ie 15C. \n\nAnd yet we're told that the 'pre-industrial period' (from 1850-1900) the surface temp was supposed to be around 13.7C - so that the warming since then has been 1.3C. But  where does the idea that the 1890's were  cooler than today come from? - tree ring and coral rings data and climate models that ASSUME the past was cooler, and because they ASSUME co2 causes warming - therefore if today is 15C, the past must be cooler.....ie the climate models hindcast temps. And as per YOUR quoted paper - they are wrong.\n\nSo if co2 is causing warming, why has the surface temp not changed in 128yrs? and why were Arrhenius' calcs wrong? - we've had a 50% increase in co2 since 1896 (280ppm) and temp is still the same?"

                "Content": "> stated the globe's average surface temp was 15C\n\nEkholm notes that the 15.1\u00b0C is observed meteorological data, so he's talking about the near surface air temperature SAT. In a paper from 1906 iirc Arrhnenius writes that he assumes that the ground temperature is equal to the SAT. Nobody measures the ground temperature.\n\nHapper makes something similiar on page 8: [*We assume that the Earth has come to complete thermal equilibrium with an absolute surface temperature*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00808), there are several more assumptions, like: *We assume the Earth is a perfect \u201cblackbody\u201d for both sunlight and thermal radiation, in the sense that the surface absorbs all radiation incident on it, irrespective of the frequency or direction of the incident light.*\n\nIf you read further it looks like Happer is a little confused, he mentions pressure, the barometric formula, the standard atmosphere and more. Once again we can see there's [no defined \"greenhouse\" effect](https://osf.io/j7y8v/download/?format=pdf).\n\n> In 36 years the CAGW proponents have not been able to come up with a GHE idea and stick\nwith it. Their ideas keep changing and morphing into something different. Each time one idea\ngets falsified they switch to another. Any discussion with these people always ends up in a\ncircular argument. They start with 1. When you falsify that they move to 2, then to 3 then to 4.\nWhen you falsify 4 they move back to 1 again. All the GHE ideas that have been put forward\nfail experiment and have been falsified in many different ways. The CAGW proponents have\nto keep changing them because they can\u2019t validate any of them in an experiment."

Check out Boston, Texas, Washington...all the same.\n\n>Rapid rates of change in the past...\n\nSo we agree natural events in the past exceed today. The whole global, not global is a big rabbit hole. One better spared outside of Reddit (or we could be here all night).\n\nHey, it was a good exchange of thoughts. Respectful, seemed we listened to each other. A good Reddit day."

It shows perfect absorption at a wavelength of 15 micrometer (peak of long wave emission) over a distance of 30 cm. In practice, all long wave energy at 15 micrometer is absorbed in about 10 meters of air @ 430 ppm. Adding more CO2 is not changing anything."

The electric to run the mega speakers and lighting. The emissions of all the fans going to the shows. The trash from the fans of the shows. Thousands upon thousands of tons of CO2 and garbage. So people can listen to her sing to them in person instead of on Spotify, YouTube, etc.\n\nTo be clear, I don't fault her for touring and fault her fans for wanting to go. I fault them for doing so AND preaching about the climate and environmentalism. As well as fault those that will scold me for not wanting to sacrifice my own moderate quality of life while turning a blind eye to this. I'm supposed to spend a ton of money on a shitty new electric car with limited range that decreases over time and massively inconveniences me with long charging times (compared to gassing up), but you won't even MENTION Swift's private jet and world tour or try to get such luxuries regulated to the extent you'd regulate me into an electric car? Fuck off. If the climate is such an existential threat, why would you do so much to contribute to the damage for something that is 100% purely luxury and entertainment? Yet again, their actions do not align with their stated beliefs."

Firstly, it causes the water to sublimate into water vapor that rises and becomes clouds, which reflect the sun's heat. \n\nAs a SCUBA diver, I have seen how quickly the sun's light falls off as you descend. Red light is nearly non existent beyond 20 feet. Green and blue light goes much deeper, which is why the ocean looks sorta blue green.\n\nI would imagine the ocean bottom at the equator might be a little warmer than it is at the poles, but I don't think it's a huge difference. The depths are COLD. Diving off south Florida in the summertime, surface temperature water would be in the 80s. At 50 feet it'd be in the 60s and getting colder the deeper you go."

In an opinion column titled \u201cFive Lies About Tobacco,\u201d Bast once repeatedly claimed that health concerns regarding cigarette smoking were overblown and worth ignoring. At first, Bast denied that he had ever dismissed concerns about smoking and disputed the quote we read to him.\n\n>\u201dIn 1998, you wrote in a Heartland op-ed that smoking cigarettes has little to no adverse health effects,\u201d we noted. \u201cDo you stand by that?\u201d\n\n>\u201dNo, I never wrote that,\u201d replied Bast. \u201cWhy would I have written something like that?\u201d Bast asked to see the op-ed, and promised to \u201ccontest\u201d it.\n\n>Later, Republic Report returned and read Bast\u2019s op-ed to him. Watch the video below:\n\n>After reading his op-ed to him \u2014 which claimed moderate smoking is not deadly and has \u201cfew, if any adverse health effects\u201d \u2014 Bast then reaffirmed his comments, but hedged, arguing that he meant \u201cone or two cigarettes a day or week.\u201d We read another line from his piece, which at the time claimed up to seven cigarettes a day does not raise the risk of lung cancer. Bast again confirmed his sentiment.\n\n>Heartland has gone to great lengths to argue that its attacks on public health or climate science are not motivated by the vast amounts of funding it receives from industry groups. But again, the tobacco wars are an instructive reminder of Heartland\u2019s agenda.\n\nhttps://www.prwatch.org/news/2014/05/12464/heartland-institute-reluctantly-stands-denial-cigarette-smoking-risks"

Sick really.\n\nWhere I could fault the WEF et.al. possible laser focus on one objective, without considering all aspects, like people being relocated outside of the newly made flood plane (that hasn't existed for the last 150 years).

In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs. In 2022, another 133 were demolished. According to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, Spain has been a leading exponent of dam removal. Last year it was second only to France, and the year before that it topped the EU league for dismantling them.\n\nReuters claims a debunk https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/map-shows-existing-river-barriers-not-dams-removed-before-deadly-valencia-floods-2024-11-11/\n\nIMO this mirrors the EU ecobureaucrat fiasco of recent decades of not dredging rivers, in the name of making Nature happy, rivers that had been dredged in prior centuries, then with less space in the rivers meant more flooding, more citizens lives damaged. More broadly it mirrors many dilettantish things Western govts have been doing.  \n\nI am not sure about the dams. But I do know the same people first went after CO2 . then methane, then nitrogen,and now dams.. these ecowarrior bureaucrats are nasty & stupid and they are something betwen dreamers and religious nuts.\n\nbtw in related news the science-less  editor of \"scientific american\" has been forced to resign.

If you want to live in delusion it's not my job to cure you.  Just don't impose your bullshit on us.  But the cult needs to impose their lunacy on others.  And the reason is that they cannot have a factual debate of the issues that would convince sane people that Man has a significant effect on the global climate.  For them personally I enjoy watching them living their lives in never ending despair because we are all going to die.  What a waste when just an open mind to undeniable facts would wake them up"

Fukushima is the reverse of a miracle where all the things that could go wrong did go wrong, and in the end the area is actually livable but the Japanese want to be on the safe side and I understand that. Chernobyl is what gross incompetence and corruption produce. Three mile island was bad luck and bad protocol following, and was severely overblown.

Still, we should all note that everywhere is \"ecologically-sensitive.\" The objective math is always difficult because we tend to favor environments with big mammals or struggle emotionally with the potential loss of endangered species, distracting us from big picture ecology (the ocean is a great example, overfishing, pollution).\n\nEvery type of energy generation has an impact. Compact energy sources have a smaller footprint and are dispatchable. Renewables have a large footprint, are intermittent, and are mining intensive. Frankly, the left's climate solutions are loony and expensive, and if everyone adopted your more pragmatic stance, we could strip away some of the divisive politics and serve multiple agendas. Unfortunately, environmental extremists are successfully driving the narrative through raw emotional appeal. Isn't it about time we reject that? I mean, we have a robust regulatory framework, what is the real danger?\n\nNatural gas for the short term, nuclear for the win, with an optimistic eye toward emerging tech."

Few working Americans can privilege long-term concern for the planet as a whole over concern about paying monthly bills for their home. Any legislation that increases net costs of energy ripples outward to increase the cost of living overall. My own support for climate progress is much more in the direction of cost-effective sustainable energy development and efficiency-incentives over stopping or even limiting oil and gas from anywhere with an already well-developed petroleum industry (the question of drilling in wilderness and ecologically-sensitive *new* sites is a different story in my book, but that's probably largely because I'm a middle class tree hugger...)"

The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming \u2013 leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.\u2019 \n\n> No doubt in BBC-world they actually believe that polar bears are dying out. It is, after all, an article of faith for the global warming cult. However, far from declining, the world\u2019s population of polar bears has tripled since the 1960s, thanks to the ban on hunting in 1973."

                "Content": "I cannot believe I\u2019m saying this, but there seems to be something useful coming out of state governments. This is encouraging.\u00a0\n\nThis is not only happening with coal; Blackrock has publicly ostracized Big Oil, but has also invested in these companies. Exxon and Chevron are sitting on billions of barrels of oil (which can be sold @ $68/barrel) and benefit from an increase in price due to governments making it harder to drill for oil. Blackrock and Vanguard reap the benefits.\n\nFrom OP\u2019s article:\nFinally, a strike at the heart of the Blob\nTexas and 10 other US States have pressed\u00a0the radioactive Antitrust legal button and\u00a0filed against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The states claim the money managers bought up large stakes in coal companies and then colluded to promote ESG and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) goals that reduced coal output. The decreased supply of coal, in turn increased the cost of electricity to consumers. It was fundamentally anti-competitive behaviour. These three companies together have $26 Trillion dollars of assets under management. That\u2019s only one trillion smaller than the entire US GDP.\n\nIn this case, some of the collusion hidden in clear view. The three money managers said they were trying to save the world and to protect the people, and they joined groups like the GFANZ and Net Zero alliances like Climate Action 100+. But in the end, these three financial giants had collectively acquired close to 30% of most US Coal companies, and even though they claimed to have good intentions, the 11 State Attorney Generals argue that any extraneous claims of social benefits are irrelevant. These three companies have profited immensely while customers have been denied access to a free and open market, and have paid higher electricity bills.\n\nIn a democracy, the people are supposed to decide the policies, not the Oligarchs."

I just want to be left alone and believe in laissez faire, while the WEF/Democrat/neoliberal crowd is pushing a very authoritarian agenda, which is killing the middle and lower classes and Net Zeroing us all into poverty, without any experimental verification.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAbout the methodology. The first question asked is \u201cDo you believe in climate change\u201d. Apparently, they still managed to find 54% of participants to answer no, even though I would find myself in the \u201cyes\u201d category. This raises questions about the study design.\u00a0\n\nThe article has too many simple spelling errors. Connexion - connection. It had two authors. At least one of them has proofread it? And it goes on and on and on, making the same claims several times, as if it was written by an undergraduate student who still believes more words mean better marks.

(This sounds like an equipment malfunction rather than a real reason).\n\nIs it an instantaneous reading or a longer term average?

Pre-industrial levels can be found [here](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/03/met-office-atmospheric-co2-industrial-levels-environment-climate-change/). 278 ppm, at a time it could not be measured, is an estimate \u2026 call it 3/10,000.

There can be nearby concentrated sources (our breath, or exhaust pipes), but the same concentrated sinks just don't exists, so levels don't go past a few ppm below background average levels. \n\nSo I'd say your household monitor is having some sort of technical error during periods of rain, as the 250 ppm reading just doesn't make physical sense, and isn't supported by other properly calibrated measurements."

The combination, typical of cold anticyclones, of low temperatures (which increase demand) and the almost total absence of wind (which hinders wind generation) configures one of the worst possible scenarios for the price of electricity: it forces the burning of more gas in combined cycle plants, which are much more expensive, and that substantially increases the bill. This dreaded cocktail, which is currently hitting Central Europe, is leading the price of electricity in Europe\u2019s largest economy to levels not seen since the energy crisis.\n\n[Sweden Blasts Germany For Rising Electricity Prices](https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/sweden-blasts-germany-for-rising-electricity-prices-88720)\n\n> Germany's recent power issues stemmed from what has been described as \"Dunkelflaute,\" where neither wind nor solar power can meet demand. This led to energy prices soaring after the country experienced low renewable output. Busch noted, \"Because of exports of power to Germany when prices rise, supply decreases here too, leading to increased prices for Swedish consumers.\"\n\n> Germany and Sweden\u2019s discussions are underscored by the broader European dilemma of energy dependency, particularly as member states work through limiting fossil fuel use against rising market demands. The intertwined situations of various countries are now highlighting the vulnerabilities within the energy market and exposing weaknesses of diversified sources."

There is a time and place.\n\nMy biggest argument against renewables is, even if the wind stops blowing for just one day a year, there needs to be a whole backup system sitting there not used for the other 364 days of the year to cover the shortfall. That's wasteful, expensive, inefficient. Those gas turbines need to be sitting on idle ready to go. The system needs to be overbuilt to compensate.\n\nSure batteries, pumped hydro, etc can rectify this to a degree, but these are also expensive, environmental impact, two systems need to be maintained, dams, water turbines, batteies, etc.\n\nIf the wind never stopped, I'd be all for the wind to be part of the energy mix."

The video is a cut-down version of a much longer discussion and therefore lacks some context.\n\nWhat the speaker is implying is wind and solar are only available for a fraction of each day. That might vary, but it's typically only 20%. However, as you've pointed out, there are places where availability is more than that. But I'm sure wind turbines do not operate 100% of the time anywhere, even the place you mentioned. \n\nAlso wind turbines require a steady wind between \\~43 km/h  to \\~80 km/h to operate. This further reduces their operating availability."

I am in the west and the bulk of our electricity comes from Muja and Collie that were coal plants and have been converted to natural gas which the state has an abundance of. One coal plant is still running called Bluewater and is only 10 years old so will go for another 50 years. I just did a 3000 km trip north to Karratha and back to see my brother in pt Samson and go fishing. I noticed most roadhouses had solar and it works brilliantly. The generator set at Overlander was not even running. I am a big fan of wind and solar in the right places it just will not supply the entire planet. The East coast has no gas reserves and is still mostly coal fired. The west could send gas but they do not have unloading facilities yet. Renewable energy is quaint but unreliable"

This helps to control floods. \u00a0\n\nThe buffer capacity is reduced when dams are removed, similar to how the buffer capacity is reduced when trees are cut, beaver dams are removed and other vegetation is cut. Remember erosion from your primary school text books?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If you do not believe dams help to reduce flooding, be my guest and start cutting trees and vegetation in mountainous areas.

Those in tandem together can help avoid the devastation that we are seeing in Spain.\u201d\n\nI lived in Japan, and within 500 meters of our house their were three large reservoirs, which could store millions of liters of water in case of freak weather. The Japanese are very risk averse and know how to take care of these risks.\n\nThis is indeed how you handle these things.

One would think that even the climate-obsessed European elites will be under no illusion about what a Trump administration would make of the U.N.\u2019s push for transfers of vast financial resources to poor countries for what is essentially bad weather. As they might say in Main Street U.S.A., \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s watch.\n\n> Indeed, among Mr. Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters will likely be the host of COP29, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, who described his country\u2019s oil and gas resources as \u201ca gift from God\u201d.

A frequency that CO2 can now absorb. CO2 absorbs that heat energy and release it. Some of that released energy heads\u00a0out into space but some heads back down towards earth.\u00a0\n\nThe visible and infrared enter the atmosphere, heating the surface. The heated surface emits black body radiation with a maximum at a wavelength of 15 micrometer, exactly the wavelength where CO2 is a *perfect* absorber.\n\nIt absorbs all of the energy. Nothing makes it to space. Only a little bit of CO2 is needed to make this happen. Adding more CO2 is not going to make less radiation at 15 micrometer reach space, because it is all absorbed already.\n\nEarlier, Hanssen er al insisted 50% of the energy was returned through emitted photons (radiation) back to earth. This is incorrect, because the absorbed radiation is dissipated through collisions with neighboring gas molecules, warming the air. But nothing in this process changes by adding more CO2.\n\nThe problem here for alarmists is that CO2 is a perfect greenhouse gas.. For their story to work, a *weak* greenhouse gas would have made more sense. A gas which absorbs 10% of all radiation emitted towards space. In this case, doubling its concentration would double the absorption, causing more warming (of the air). It then would still be a question whether the warming would lead to any warming we could experience, or any warming of the air, which would improve convection -> which incidentally improves cooling."

                "Content": "It is not easy, because the underlying physics are complex and interdisciplinary, meaning there are only a few people who have a full overview to understand the relationship between higher concentrations of CO2 and warming.\n\nThis perhaps explains why 97% of climate scientists believe in man made climate change, because they read newspapers. They cannot all fully understand the problem, because they are not all multidisciplinary scientists.\n\nFor instance, without a thorough understanding of spectroscopy, there is no point in trying to figure this out. But spectroscopy experts often have zero practical experience with thermodynamics or fluid mechanics. They see spectra everywhere, but don\u2019t understand adiabatic processes.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, our universities have put so much attention to the theory (which is easiest to teach) and almost no effort in teaching students how to properly do science. Out of 1000 students, there are a handful of BPhil students and PhD students who will have the opportunity to properly do science, but even in this group, ~50% prefer to do politics or marketing to advance their careers over doing thorough science. Science requires common sense, and common sense is spread thin.\n\nThen there is the cognitive bias: if you expect a causal relationship between increased levels of CO2 and rising temperatures, you will find it. This is how our brain works. A good example is Sabine Hossenfelder, who is a good scientist, but who has bought into the concept of CO2 induced warming and can no longer see the forrest for the trees.\n\nWe have already mentioned the bias induced by grant agencies and the publishing system, both promoting science which fits the warming narrative and ruining the careers of those who do not toe the warming line.\u00a0"

Instead we find that with the increase of co2, theres more energy being radiated. its almost like the biosphere is a self regulating system\n\n[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10712-024-09838-8.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10712-024-09838-8.pdf)\n\nthe above paper shows that there has been an increase in absorbed solar radiation, primarily observed in the oceans, and this is partially offset by an increase in OLR (when co2 emits radiant energy to space).

                "Content": "> Notably, there remains an unexplained gap of about 0.2\u00b0C in the global temperature rise. A team from the Alfred Wegener Institute proposes a compelling hypothesis: the Earth\u2019s surface has become less reflective due to a decline in certain types of clouds. This reduction in reflectivity may help explain the additional warming\n\n> \u201cIn addition to the influence of El Ni\u00f1o and the expected long-term warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases, several other factors have already been discussed that could have contributed to the surprisingly high global mean temperatures since 2023,\u201d says Dr Helge Goessling, main author of the study from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI): e.g. increased solar activity, large amounts of water vapor from a volcanic eruption, or fewer aerosol particles in the atmosphere. But if all these factors are combined, there is still 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming with no readily apparent cause.\u201c\n\n> The 0.2-degree-Celsius \u2018explanation gap\u2019 for 2023 is currently one of the most intensely discussed questions in climate research,\u201d says Helge Goessling. In an effort to close that gap, climate modelers from the AWI and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) took a closer look at satellite data from NASA, as well as the ECMWF\u2019s own reanalysis data, in which a range of observational data is combined with a complex weather model. In some cases, the data goes back to 1940, permitting a detailed analysis of how the global energy budget and cloud cover at different altitudes have evolved.\n\nNow let them find out that the oceans are a humungous heat capacitor that is not warmed by the colder atmosphere. Someone needs to tell them. Oh, wait..."

They don't have a weather station every 1,000 yards in a grid across the earth. So they take two readings and then estimate the shit out of enormous huge swaths of various regions.\n\nYou may think that's scientifically possible, and you may even be right. But the problem is all of the people behind the wheel are OD'ing off the climate alarmism kool-aid that their biases are bleeding through into their data.\n\nSo what we end up with is hysteria getting it's hands on the pendulum and forcefully putting it somewhere that's at odds with what we can realistically expect the world to look like."

Alas, enjoy it only a little while longer since this story may have to be retired after putting in such a sterling propaganda shift. Global temperatures are falling like a stone, while the oceans are cooling at a remarkably rapid rate. \n\n> Land temperatures are also falling with the UAH satellite record recently showing some significant monthly falls. Except for satellites accurately measuring the atmosphere near the Earth, we must treat most land surface temperature numbers with caution if not cynicism given how much we have recently discovered about urban heat corruption, invented data, retrospective adjustments and scandalously lax station siting policies. Nevertheless, it would appear that land temperatures are starting to fall and cooler oceans will hasten this process."

The 12-year ENSO cycle identified by their wavelet analysis they attribute to underwater volcanic activity; it does not correspond to any solar cycle or other known natural source of warming.\n\n[Volcanic Eruptions and Solar Activity](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1989/1989_Stothers_st07500u.pdf)\n\n> The historical record of large volcanic eruptions from 1500 to 1980, as contained in two recent catalogs, is subjected to detailed time series analysis. Two weak, but probably statistically significant, periodicities of \u223c11 and \u223c80 years are detected. Both cycles appear to correlate with well-known cycles of solar activity; the phasing is such that the frequency of volcanic eruptions increases (decreases) slightly around the times of solar minimum (maximum). \n\n> The weak quasi-biennial solar cycle is not obviously seen in the eruption data, nor are the two slow lunar tidal cycles of 8.85 and 18.6 years. Time series analysis of the volcanogenic acidities in a deep ice core from Greenland, covering the years 553-1972, reveals several very long periods ranging from \u223c80 to \u223c350 years and are similar to the very slow solar cycles previously detected in auroral and carbon 14 records. \n\n> Solar flares are believed to cause changes in atmospheric circulation patterns that abruptly alter the earth's spin. The resulting jolt probably triggers small earthquakes which may temporarily relieve some of the stress in volcanic magma chambers, thereby weakening, postponing, or even aborting imminent large eruptions. In addition, decreased atmospheric precipitation around the years of solar maximum may cause a relative deficit of phreatomagmatic eruptions at those times."

It creates a lot of uncertainty.\u201d If Trump pulls the U.S. out of the emissions accord, businesses would likely suffer because it is counterproductive for them \u201cto have the pendulum swing back and forth as administrations change.\u201d\n\nTrump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement during his first term in keeping with his stance that climate change is not the catastrophic existential threat it is being made out to be. There appears to be a general agreement that he would try to do the same during this term as well.\n\n**Exxon, however, has staked billions on the energy transition, especially in the carbon capture segment**. Last year, the company paid $5 billion for Denbury Resources, a carbon dioxide pipeline network operator. Besides that acquisition, Exxon has also recently signed three more deals for carbon capture and storage, one with CF Industries, one with industrial gas makers Linde, and one with steelmaker Nucor. Earlier this year Exxon also said it had teamed up with Shell to develop carbon capture and storage solutions for Singapore.\n\nCarbon capture and storage is the obvious choice for many oil producers who want to reduce their carbon footprint\u2014or help others reduce theirs. Investment, however, needs to expand considerably under net-zero scenarios.\n\nWith a view to all these investments already made, it really would be uncertainty-inducing if Trump lifts the Paris Agreement obligation for companies to reduce their emissions. However, it does not mean he would ban them from reducing their emissions in any way they see fit, including through carbon capture.\n\nBy Irina Slav for [Oilprice.com](http://Oilprice.com) Nov 12, 2024, 2:01 AM CST",
