                "Content": ">Can you give an example? It sounds like putting livestock next to crops, and then rotating them around periodically, which makes sense.\n\nI don't understand why crops (if this refers to plant crops such as corn/soy/wheat) are needed at all. I can give three examples from direct experience. During 2017-2019 I lived at a sheep farm, a bison/yak/chickens farm, and a sheep/chickens/herbs farm (herbs in a separate area from livestock).\n\nThe first and third are in higher-precipitation mountain areas and the animals graze all year. They're moved from one paddock to another occasionally, so that plants do not get over-grazed. For both, the land looks fantastic, very dense green grass and with great root systems that limit erosion and provide great water retention capacity. I saw a lot of wild animals at each farm. There were wild turkeys roaming freely at one of them. Birds liked these areas, there was an interesting assortment of various rodents and other types of small animals, plus a lot of obvious insect life. Everything was in harmony: wildlife and livestock didn't bother one another, predator insects removed a sufficient number of plant-destroying insects that plants were healthy, birds etc. added fertilizer by their droppings etc. (the animals are even useful after they die, by leaving nutrients). Rain and sunlight fed the whole process.\n\nThe second ranch is in a low-precipitation flat desert area. At this farm, the soil had been very poor when the owners bought the property, it was sandy and barely supported the hardiest plants. Over time, more and more grazers were added and the soil became more and more rich with organic material. It now is very green and has dense, deep root systems, growing a lot of grass mostly. It is the greenest area in this region, easily noticed in satellite images. The irrigation is from a creek that runs through the property and while pumping is happening the creek isn't altered much. At this farm especially, there was a high density of wild animals, more than I'd ever seen in any natural area such as an old-growth forest. It was like a Disney film. I swear this happened: on one occasion as I walked past the pond, there were about thirty dragonflies curiously circling me. Often when I stepped out of my RV, I'd find rabbits or chipmunks outside the door. There would be frogs at the water faucet or hiding under the vehicle in the shade. Etc.\n\nNone of the farms use pesticides or manufactured fertilizers. They only occasionally use any fossil-fueled machinery such as a tractor (maintaining roads, stuff like that). The bison/yak ranch, being in an area that became snow-covered in winter, bought locally grown hay that was grown basically like weeds and harvested with minimal use of products. There are neighboring farms growing hemp/canola, the soil on those lots looks relatively dead and wild animals tend to avoid those areas. A farmer told me that the neighbors' soil lacks worms. There are obvious erosion issues.\n\nThere are other ranchers with whom I'm acquainted via farmers' markets or my social network, and there are online discussion groups about farming including ranching from which I gain a lot of info. Anyone who has a basic understanding of farming knows that ranches are low-mechanization, low-maintenance, and good for wild animals (not predators, the farms with which I'm acquainted though keep those out using fences/dogs rather than eliminating them).",

                "Content": ">This sounds like a 2nd, separate, argument. But I don't really understand.\n\nWhat's the problem? Such land is not practical for growing human-consumed plant crops because of issues such as being too dry, too step, too cold, or too hot. [This document](http://www.ilse-koehler-rollefson.com/?p=1160) has a lot of information about pastures and arability. It also explains major flaws of the Poore & Nemecek 2018 study, upon which many claims about livestock and environment are based. Using pasture land for growing livestock with minimal human-made inputs is an efficient use for food. Those areas of course could be rewilded, though this has two major issues. Wilderness, if it is cut off from other wilderness (highways, housing developments, fenced farms, urban areas, etc.) limits migration which causes issues of food availability and such for wild animals. It can be difficult to get predator/prey balance, once humans have industrialized an area. The [rewilding at Oostvaardersplassen](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/dutch-rewilding-experiment-backfires-as-thousands-of-animals-starve) is an infamous example of rewilding gone horribly wrong, a lot of herbivores were killed to spare them from slow gruesome starvation. There can be too much predation which wipes out the useful grazers and eliminates food for carnivores, or the herbivores can overpopulate and wipe out their own food supply. Also, if the area is not used for food for humans then food must be produced elsewhere which can further burden the planet with pesticides, artificial fertilizers, and expanses of mono-crops which invite issues such as pest proliferation and other issues caused by lack of diversity. When replacing animal foods with plant foods, much more food must be eaten due to lower nutritional density/completeness/bioavailability. So, more farming, more mechanization, more products.\n\n>...than the relatively short-term pollution from pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nCurrently-legal pesticides tend to biodegrade in the environment, but it can take a long time and they cause issues while they are degrading. Fertilizers, however, largely are permanent pollution. Minerals do not break down over time. Methane from grazing animals, as explained EVERY DAY ON REDDIT, is constantly being sequestered and at about the rate it is emitted. So really, there isn't additional methane from grazing added to the atmosphere and especially in the long  term (grazers on poor soil can improve sequestration of the plants/soil). If grazing livestock cause an environmental problem, how do grazing wild animals not cause that exact problem? The suggestion for pastures is \"rewild them\" so they're removed from our food system but the same \"pollution\" occurs anyway? Somebody, make sense of this.\n\nI don't see where you answered the question in my first sentence of the previous comment. If you think that prices should be raised for meat to compensate for the environmental problems you believe are caused by raising meat, then shouldn't this proportionally be the case for foods raised with pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, and intensive mechanization?",

If we lower our demand, then we can supply all of the demand with sustainable farms like you describe in the US.\n\n\\> Does your belief apply also to costs of environmentally harmful pesticides and artificial fertilizers?\n\nYes:\n\n1. Poisoning a river with pesticides sounds like a very expensive problem.  But ruining the global climate for hundreds (thousands?) of years is way bigger and way more expensive.  Think of one country ruining their rivers.  It costs an insane amount of money to fix it (depending on size of country/rivers), but it's possible.

                "Content": "Most deforestation attributed to grazing is for soy crops that are grown for both human consumption and livestock feed. The soybeans are farmed for soy oil that is used in human-consumed food products including alternatives to meat, biofuel, inks, candles, etc. while the leftover bean solids are typically fed to livestock. Some of the rest of the deforestation attributed to grazing is to create new pastures after soybean farming has pushed ranchers off of their pastures (they may not own the land, and having made the land very fertile by grazing animals on it the area becomes desirable for wealthier farmers and corporations whom can buy the land or pay the government to use it).\n\nYou really think that a country fixes their rivers after pesticide contamination? Also, the supply chains of pesticides, artificial fertilizers, and other products that are needed more when pasture livestock is not used for foods, involve a lot of fossil fuel pollution.\n\nYou seem focused on the belief in livestock's contribution to climate change, while ignoring that fossil fuel pollution of plant farming is net-additional (further burdens the planet the more pollution is caused) while emissions of grazing livestock are cyclical (can cycle between atmosphere and land/oceans endlessly with no net increase in atmospheric methane). This conversation started when I replied to your comment suggesting apparently that there be fees paid for animal foods (you said \"Beef costs society, we should charge more\"). So I pointed out costs to society of alternative foods, and you're bringing it back to GHG emissions of livestock when GHG emissions are more a problem with industrialized plant agriculture.\n\n>It's complicated to get the world to do sustainable pesticide-free farming, compared to a simple global carbon tax.\n\nSustainable pesticide-free farming is already happening on pastures. Annual plant farming [ruins soil](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/1dyxxiq/comment/lcggu6i/). You seem to have said that you think there should be a carbon tax on \"beef\" (I guess animal agriculture?) but not food production that contributes much more to climate change. The ammonia fertilizer industry for example, all by itself, causes enormous emissions. It was [recently found](https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/doi/10.1525/elementa.358/112487/Estimation-of-methane-emissions-from-the-U-S) that the industry has been emitting about 100 times more methane than it estimated, enough to be significant for climate effects. Without livestock, more of the stuff is needed. Emissions of diesel-powered farm machinery, production of pesticides and artificial fertilizers, etc. contribute more to climate change since they are net-additional. Every bit of additional emissions from fossil fuels increases the amount that the planet must sequester if it is not to remain in the atmosphere. Also, it would make a lot more sense to surcharge unnecessary use of automobiles, ships, and planes (neighborhood trips by able-bodied people, recreational travel, etc.). Transportation has a lot more impact than farming, regardless of what you've heard from pushers of the myth that cyclical methane is pollution in the same way as pollution from fossil fuels.",

But people didnt do much, lived on, and nothing changed much did it? This one\u2019s true, because exxon admitted to it lol. \n\nNow its warm in november in several countries up in the northern hemisphere. Still no biggie right? People are alive, animals are alive, there are trees, rivers etc.\n\nIf it gets incrementally hotter continually, temperatures that are currently pushing to 30-40C in extended periods of summer will now push up to 40-50C that lasts half a year within a decade if the emissions continue to follow the current trend and skyrocket. \n\nIf that happens, crops will be burnt, livestocks will die, wildlife will die from the heat. Not all em. But enough to make them endangered. And then they will disappear quietly. Humans will be the last to go - so even up until then we\u2019ll probably be hearing the same ol\u2019 lines from people like you - \u201cpesky doomers and their pessimism thought the world will end but we\u2019re still here haha.\u201d As we open tuna cans and eat ramen boiling in incredibly acidic water with microplastics \ud83d\ude02\n\nWell, we\u2019re all gonna die 1 - every living thing dies eventually.

                "Content": "Thanks for asking, I have noticed the same a sentiment provided without specifics as well. Here is my radical left-wing extremist hot take: I think it will require people to start intentional communities where everyone works to grow the cooperative in a way that provides housing, food security and education with a unified political goal.\n\nThere are two big issues right now. The first is that people are largely uneducated and cant act in their own self interest due to being poorly informed and unable to make optimal decisions under a given set of constraints. Second is that the barrier to entry to fixing the first problem is insurmountable when people are working all the time to get by.\n\nHumans evolved to work together, but the native americans, black americans and with the mass adoption of the suburb, many working class americans have been isolated and rendered unable to cooperate towards a common goal. This is a strategy used by the authorities to fragment power and maintain the population under control.\n\nI think the only way forward is for people to be willing to form cooperatives and intentional communities (especially nonprofit). This is not unrealistic, a shit ton of research in the sciences is done by graduate students who are experts in their field and are paid wages slightly above poverty level. A good chuck of educators already fall in here. Contributors to open source projects also fall in here. But goodwill only goes so far when you have to pay rent which is inflated by nimby property investors or you need healthcare run by private equity or you or feed yourself when groceries are price gouged. If there were a nonprofit entity which provided housing and produced its own food, this would help lessen the burden. This is not unrealistic either as various universities accomplish this in a limited capacity. However the healthcare would require backing by an entity like a state and would require a large lifestyle change for most people (like getting rid of car dependence) to be successful.\n\nAnother important factor is peer review and audit. Any of these entities would be a prime target for corruption. The financial transactions would need constant oversight by the public and there would need to be some democratic input by a well informed electorate somewhere along the policy decision chain.\n\nOne way to do this is to start a 501c3 organization. The mission should be something to help the community such as providing housing to teachers/grad students/activists/etc who want to work towards fixing the future, community development and education, or food security. Alternatively you could start an irs recognized religious organization where the religion, just sets forth a set of beliefs that we should promote education and sustainability (doesn't have to be supernatural mythology). In various states, these organizations qualify for property and sales tax exemptions and can receive tax deductible donations. Housing and agriculture provided by the organization would possibly have an advantage to for profit organizations in the same area and would require less funding in the form of rent or food prices to maintain and sell slightly above cost. This generated revenue needs to go towards the mission. The nonprofit could also offer other services to generate revenue, depending on the skills and expertise of its members.\n\nWith the level of tech we have, i don't see how with a well organized group and a sufficiently large labor force, people would need to work more than 20 hrs/wk to maintain or slowly grow the group. The leftover hours could be spent on people pursuing private earnings or raising a family growing the activism and humanitarian outreach or whatever they want.\n\nSome notes are that first, it would require a large voluntary open source structure where every action can be scrutinized and large actions must have some consensus. There is a ton of corruption in the nonprofit world, so the only way something like this works is if that cancer is cut out at its inception. Second, this would require recruiting experts in various areas, like law, agriculture, civil engineering, commerce, IT, etc to get this thing setup and it is difficult to get their help since everyone is so busy and tired.

Going down without a fight is exactly what they want. I intend to fight either through protests and rallies or disobedience. If he wants to repeal laws and protections then protesting and making him feel the repercussions in the economy is the best action.

However we have to spin it to safeguard the planet and make it an appealing action for the far right is what we need to do. But I am creating posters to display at the White House and capital about the climate clock  4 year deadline. I don\u2019t want anyone to give up.

My thought is likely some mix of encourage people to change habits and support wider solar rollout in whatever ways become obvious to you.  Increasingly pushing whole home electrification as a cost-conscious measure might be one area we stand to make a huge gain in; realistically, if we can tie it to societal views on \"success\" (as in, make gas appliances old fashioned and unpopular), it might help rollout and staying power\n\nWhat can you do to protect at-risk environments?  I kind of have got nothing.  Work within established charitable structures to buy land and put it in trusts, or donate to efforts doing that?\n\nSomething which is probably going to come up in a bigger way politically at some point is the amount of regular homes for achievable prices we don't have; there are going to probably be pushes to build a lot more homes.  We need to find ways to build them sustainably and cheaply without making them homes people don't want, and I've been wondering a lot about alternate approaches to concrete as a possible thing to support more, right now they're so rudimentary but there are other options\n\nDunno how we can kill the commercial flying industry but it has to happen eventually\n\nDual power in weather prediction is going to become increasingly needed, and in medicine/public health\n\nEdit: pushing to end meat industry subsidies would be awesome.

Are you a good marketer? organizer? maybe start rallying people for protests and demonstrations. Are you an educator? engage youth, lead by example, and incorporate sustainable practices into your lessons. Engineer? Read up and find ways to incorporate sustainable practices in your projects. Economist? Push back on the misinformation! amplify your voice! Find ways to test circular economies. There are so many things to do and they all depend on what you consider you can bring to the table.\n\nMaybe start by deciding what specific topic you want to tackle. Make it specific, even if it seems too large. Is your dragon oil subsidies? fast fashion? disinformation? biodiversity loss? choose something, then come up with an objective, then a plan. Mine is biodiversity and I am very involved in supporting the creation of subnational protected areas throughout the Americas with some NGOs. I am also an educator, and I chat with the youth a lot about our role in ecosystems and do active stewardship work. This can take on so many shapes.\n\nFinally, just make sure to follow your heart honestly. These are marathons, not sprints. Chose something that you can sustain, not something that will just be a flash in a pan. Set long objectives. Beware of the anger that these sorts of news can motivate. It can be powerful, and I do think it is a valid motivator even to the radical extremes it can push people to, but it is also an emotion that is hard to sustain and if you can't sustain it, you will likely do much harm.",

        "Content": "The UN's FAO's 2006 report, \"Livestock's Long Shadow,\" was a groundbreaking study that highlighted the significant contribution of livestock production to greenhouse gas emissions. Lots of uncertainty on what that actual number is (because this is a hard thing to figure out), but the study is undeniably directionally correct. Yet the idea that reducing meat consumption for environmental benefit continues to get blowback. This is one of the few individual choices one can make that has truly significant impact on the climate.\n\nChanging eating habits is deeply personal and shaped by tradition, accessibility, and taste. Twenty years ago, vegetarian and vegan options were less accessible, but today, plant-based foods are widely available in most urban and suburban areas. The remaining barriers are largely cultural or psychological. If climate advocates aren\u2019t willing to make this \u201csacrifice\u201d or are waiting for everyone to be forced into this \"sacrifice\" before making one themselves, can we realistically expect climate skeptics to make much larger changes in their beliefs or behaviors?\n\nOver 65% of Americans believe in climate change and support some form of climate policy, yet the percentage of vegetarians and vegans remains staggeringly low\u2014somewhere between 3-5%. This discrepancy is almost shocking. and raises a difficult but necessary question: why aren\u2019t more climate-conscious individuals taking one of the most straightforward steps to reduce their carbon footprint? Even if only climate supporters reduced their meat consumption, the US could \u201ceasily\u201d reduce its carbon footprint by 10% (as a low-end estimate) without any technological innovation or any financial investment; it would actually save our economy money. And yet, societal inaction / action suggest that many people prefer first pouring money into long-term, long-shot magic bullets. Every small action helps, and waiting for a wholesale societal change via policy is a good example of \"perfection is the enemy of progress.\"\n\n**The facts about meat and emissions**\n\n1. **Resource inefficiency.**\u00a0Producing meat is far more resource-intensive than plant-based foods. Livestock farming, particularly for beef, generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions, including methane\u2014a gas that traps significantly more heat than carbon dioxide. From a systems perspective, raising animals for food is inherently inefficient. If we think of animals as \u201cbiological machines\u201d converting energy (plants) into different forms of food (meat), each additional step in the process wastes energy. Bypassing this step with direct plant consumption is significantly more efficient.\n2. **Meat production continues to lead to deforestation around the world.**\u00a0Meat production drives deforestation worldwide. In regions like the Amazon rainforest, vast areas are cleared for grazing land or for growing feed crops. This not only releases stored carbon but also reduces the planet\u2019s capacity to absorb future emissions through the loss of trees and vegetation.\n3. **Public health benefits.**\u00a0Numerous studies have shown that lower meat consumption can lead to better health outcomes, including reduced risks of heart disease, cancer, and obesity. This isn\u2019t just a personal win\u2014it reduces the burden on public healthcare systems and avoids the downstream resource wastage tied to treating preventable chronic illnesses.\n4. **Food safety and waste.**\u00a0High levels of meat farming also contribute to contamination of crops through runoff and mishandling (e.g., E. coli outbreaks linked to cattle waste) and lead to food recalls and unnecessary waste. A reduction in meat production would alleviate these systemic issues and unnecessary deaths.\n\nWhile exceptions exist\u2014such as people with specific medical or nutritional needs\u2014these are a small fraction of the population. Similarly, some inedible resources are converted into meat (e.g., grazing on marginal land), but these exceptions don\u2019t outweigh the systemic inefficiencies and environmental costs of widespread meat consumption.\n\n**So, Why the Discrepancy?**\n\nThis is where I struggle (or perhaps I'm avoiding the obvious truth about most people). Many climate-conscious individuals are quick to advocate for renewable energy, reduced plastic use, or policy changes, yet hesitate to examine their dietary choices (and sometimes even lash out in anger when its suggested they should take a deeper look). (As an aside--do they consider that in specific situations, these policy choices could have real direct negative consequences on some people even if the overall outcome might be beneficial from a societal perspective.)\n\nIs it simply cognitive dissonance? Cultural norms? Convenience? A lack of awareness of the impact of meat consumption? Wanting to alleviate any \"guilt\" about their conscious choices? Every small action helps, and \"perfection is the enemy of progress.\"\n\nThis isn\u2019t about blame\u2014it\u2019s about alignment. If we\u2019re serious about combating climate change, why not start with one of the most impactful and immediate actions we can take: reducing or eliminating meat from our diets? This is low-hanging fruit\u2014an action where, despite debates over specifics, the overarching principles are clear and well-supported by research. \"Be the change you want to see in the world.\"\n\n  \nEDIT: (Adding my comment as an edit)\n\nClarifying thoughts on climate action in response to some comments:\n\nTL;DR: We need a multi-pronged approach, but dietary changes are one accessible, impactful action most individuals can take without financial or policy barriers. Even small changes help, no need to be an absolutist and there will always be people who physically can't make the change for some reason. Decades and decades of endless debates, investments, and technological innovations, and yet we only have 1-2% of EV penetration in the US. Solar PV growth is past an inflection point, but I wished that happened 5 to 10 years ago so that storage would be 5 to 10 years ahead of where it is.\n\nFor those of you who have made lifestyle changes or have purchased an EV, or even haven't made much change but at least recognize that there are concrete things you could do one day if you choose to, I respect that tremendously. Thank you. For everyone else, I was hoping this post would be food for thought...\n\n1. Diet is an individual action and reducing your diet's carbon footprint is often cheaper and healthier. It's about overcoming mental hurdles, not spending a fortune. Small, consistent choices can snowball into bigger change. Remember, \"New Year's resolutions\" often fail because they're all-or-nothing.\n\n2. Progress, not perfection: I'm not suggesting everyone be vegan or vegetarian. It's great if you can, but many have limitations. The point is, most people can make some dietary changes, and these changes can have a significant impact on their carbon footprint. And how can we expect climate change skeptics to make sacrifices if we wait for legislation that forces everyone's hand?\n\n3. Electric vehicles: We may all want EVs and battery recycling to be mainstream, but currently only 1-2% of US cars are electric. And if Elon gets his way and EV credits disappear, the path to cheaper EVs slows down further. \n\n5. Boycotts: Yes, boycotts don't have immediate effects, but they do hurt a corporation's bottom line if enough people participate for a sustained period of time. Short-term dips might be met with cost-cutting measures, but long-term revenue decline forces deeper cuts, impacting future growth.\n\n6. Pushing for policy changes is hard, and corporations often prioritize profit. If you think of corporations are living entities and money as food, asking a corporation to be more environmentally conscious like is like asking it to become \"vegan\".\n\n",

                "Content": "It's because people have been trained to cook and eat meat their entire lives.  Going vegetarian or vegan requires relearning how to cook, limiting your restaurant options significantly, and often times trying to convince your partner or family to do it with you.  It can be very hard for some folks, especially people who don't have the time and energy for it.\n\nAlso, vegans are terrible messengers.  I don't know why exactly.  Like, I commented on a similar thread about how I've significantly reduced my meat consumption, and got the most patronizing and sanctimonious reply from a vegan. It literally made me want to go out and eat a steak.  I know not all vegans are like that, but it's an uphill battle and a smug vegan can do a lot of damage. I feel like so many people have had bad encounters with vegans that the word is actually a bit triggering. I would advocate vegetarianism, and never utter veganism if I was trying to convince someone.\n\nThe easier sell is convincing people to reduce their meat consumption.  Cooking vegetarian at home and only ordering meat when you go out to eat is a lot easier to sell to people. Or treating meat as a once a week dish, something to eat at Sunday dinner with family. That lifestyle change is relatively easier, and can help wean people off of meat altogether. \n\nAlso, talking about how expensive meat is, how unhealthy it is, in addition to the climate impact, will sway more people than giving them a moral lecture on the virtues of veganism.",

The position the vegan movement has chosen is the ethical one, about whether the killing is morally justifiable, not whether climate impact matters.\n\nPerhaps this is because the moral argument has been around longer and is more established.  Since, in my country most children are taught to both love animals because they are cute and interesting and also eat their slaughtered bodies, which they learn about the reality of later, many people seem to have very conflicted views.

My husband really wanted a kid and thought worrying about climate change to the point of not having a kid was silly. As I\u2019m older I decided to just go for it and any of fears about having a kid were unfounded. I love being a mum and love my daughter so much. The only issue that it didn\u2019t resolve is the one around climate change. In fact it\u2019s intensified to the point now it\u2019s really affecting my quality of life.\n\nI feel so hopeless that the big companies will change things in time and we are basically headed for the end of things. That I\u2019ve brought my daughter who I love more than life itself onto a broken world and she will have a life of suffering. I\u2019m crying as I write this. I haven\u2019t had any PPD or PPA, it might be a touch of the latter but I don\u2019t know how I can improve things. I see climate issues everywhere. I wake up at night and lay awake paralysed with fear and hopelessness that I can\u2019t do anything to stop the inevitable.\n\nI am a vegetarian, mindful of my own carbon footprint, but also feel hopeless that us little people can do nothing whilst big companies and governments continue to miss targets and not prioritise the planet.\n\nI read about helping out and joining groups but I\u2019m worried it will make me worry more and think about it more than I already do.\n\nI\u2019m already on sertraline and have been for 10+ years and on a high dose, and don\u2019t feel it\u2019s the answer to this issue.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what I want from this post.

We no longer are relying on people doing the right thing for the planet; we just need them to keep doing the right thing for their wallets. \n\nYes, a delay in converting to solar is especially painful right now, as we approach what appears to be the peak of our carbon production. Yes, the climate impacts will continue worsening for some time after we turn the tends in carbon production around. But we *are* on the cusp of turning things around. \n\nDoes this mean you shouldn't worry at all? No. There will be very real impacts no matter what we do - it's too late to avoid any harm at all. But we're also getting back on track. Your child might very well live long enough to see the world starting to heal again. And that will be a beautiful thing.\n\nAnd people have been through worse and still found hope and sweetness in life. Your child has the most precious thing a person can have: People who care and want good things for them. Climate change can't take that away from your child. \n\nOf course, you still have your feelings, and feelings aren't always rational. But hopefully knowing that there are rational reasons for hope can help you feel okay about taking steps to reduce your anxiety. \n\nI don't know if you are interested in some tactics that helped me when my various health issues caused me anxiety, but I'll post them here just in case. Even if they aren't helpful now, having more tools in our toolboxes is usually a good thing.\n\nWith my anxiety, I learned that getting up for an hour or two and doing something relaxing and distracting before returning to bed helped me more than lying in bed worrying. I also learned that spraying topical magnesium oil on my skin and rubbing it in (on my legs, arms, wherever was convenient) helped me get sleepy again when I woke up in the middle of the night. I also got support from professionals at various points. Mostly just having someone available who could actively listen to me really helped. \n\nWhatever happens in the future, your child will know that you care, and that you want them to have a healthy world. And that love will mean the world to them.",

This is where I'm at,\n\nHaving children means having a stake in the world and its future in a way you never did before. You are invested. All of a sudden, you are a shareholder. The planet is your baby. You are a hero in a grand conflict that's been going on behind most of our lives and for all our lives, and it's finally your time to embrace it.\n\nHaving a family just means you are living your life. And now you are actively engaged in keeping the world whole for the lives of others. No one can say you aren't authentic, your child is living and breathing the air. You are two-feet in, committed to a noble purpose because the gamble is real, the danger is real and caring isn't a luxury or a privilege, it's a duty. And that might just be how it's supposed to work for more people to care.\n\nLives are the currency of change. We're all special but we're also part of something greater. A child being alive to live through, witness and engage with problems that need solving is simply another human being joining the adventure of humanity. I don't think there was ever a time where a person could be born beyond the touch of existential conflict.\n\nA key to remaining sane, don't sugar coat reality, nor should you undermine the resolve needed to live through it. No toxic positivity, but no victimhood either. Your child will need a stoic example. If you are alive, you are brave. It's a better default state than original sin, I feel. To be human on Earth, floating in the void, is to be intrepid, and brave. If a human being exists, it's to co-sign on reality, it's to take a place in our shared history, to rise to the occasion.\n\nYou are leaning in, you are feeling the tension of conflict, you are alive. Relieve that anxiety by taking purposeful action and meditating on your potential every day, and things will line up. You'll be a beacon for others and ready to engage when critical opportunities arrive. Until then, invest in yourself and your knowledge, build your strength, and love desperately and completely where applicable.",

Others here already gave good advice, but I'll add that you should have a mentality of \"resistance\". The biggest thing anyone can do is help shape politics. Individually we can all do our little parts but that is a drop in the bucket, so by trying to make societal level changes (and the quickest/most direct way is through legislation) it 100000x increases your individual impact. \n\nAnother thing is to have some long term planning in place to weather the worst of the coming changes, as best you can. Ideally you should have a generator, some land for growing food, solar panels, energy storage capabilities, well water, regnerative farming practices, reusing every nutrient and calorie that your land produces, etc. if you really want to be self sufficient. Of course this isn't possible for most people but start to make these types of changes if you just want to take action in general. It's a balance between going \"crazy end of the world prepper\" and doomerism, but it will help your mental health immensely.\n\nFinally, this is kind of crazy but I'm hoping my kids will be part of the solution so I'm excited to try to fix things through them. I already work in this space, and my wife is also an engineer, so our kids will have a great toolbox to become true problem solvers. So I'd recommend trying to prepare your daughter as much as possible to become a problem solver (again it's about balance here, don't go off the deep end) for this new world we'll be living in.",

This stuff has really restored my faith in humanity, keeping focus on achievable nourishing tasks in the present. We keep quail for eggs in our small urban apartment, and once I learned to crochet, I just had it in my bag and now pull out a new square on the bus or while waiting for the kettle to boil, it\u2019s second nature now and I\u2019m so glad. There are a lot of ideas, tips and instructions on Pinterest (creating boards of these can itself be therapeutic).\n\nPlus, these things are all useful skills and brilliant hobbies to raise a child along side!

Perhaps its recency bias and my own blindness at the moment and to be fair, I don't feel as su!c!dal as I could be so at the very least it isn't as dire. At the same time, it feels awful knowing not just the situation and my own helplessness but most of all how I'm never satisfied with any answers.\n\nEveryday it feels like I'm looking up the same thing: How do I deal with climate anxiety? How to do I deal with depression? Will we all die in decades? Why do anything if we all die? How can my small actions and victories mean anything if ultimately we will suffer global climate change? How do I enjoy life, hang out with family and friends, spend leisure time with art, if we have this massive threat over us all? \n\nAnd what's so frustrating is just a month ago I felt like I had all this fire in me. I wanted to quit my job to find a more purposful and meaningful work. I did quit and I have been looking and now that fire seems dim and needs to be lit again.\n\nI've internalized some of the responses but at the same time, I'm not satisfied or perhaps I'm too stubborn to accept them.\n\nI know that it (likely) won't mean humanity will be extinct but that doesn't mean it won't be a disaster that hundreds of millions if not billions will die (and this is even with advances in medicine and food).\n\nI know that there are transitions around the world towards renewable energy (mostly because of China and India) but we're still not close eto capping emissions and certainly not at zero.\n\n\"It's not too late, and every nth degree will matter\" but at the same time it will be bad and I don't see how we can go around that. Not to mention, we know we will have to deal with fascism and capitalism's power which will set us back further for at least a few more years. It's hard not to give up hope when we know it will be tough.\n\nI don't know how to not avoid news yet also stay up to date as to not feel guilty about wanting to bury my head in the sand. \n\nMost of all, I hate how out of control everything is. I want to be able to help as much as I can but I'm also a hedonist in that I want to enjoy life as much as I want, savor it. I want to discuss and dissect all the movies I want to, and write both fiction and nonfiction without feeling like I'm just deluding or distracting myself. And though I also don't subscribe to antinatilism as I think it's juvenile to think suffering = life isn't worth living...I also don't know how I would want a child knowing they'll likely have even greater climate anxiety and depression than me and yes, I do want a family.\n\nI guess I just wanna ask the question everyone in life asks: how do you keep going? How do you stay stubborn in the face of not just climate change but also cosmic nihilism - that one day we will all be forgotten? I was talking with my friend about this yesterday and I realized that a lot of answers seemed irrational to me, not computing with my logical brain. I understand philosophy isn't tangible but I also know without that I'm going to be in the same pattern of looking up the same questions over and over again? So how do y'all do it?",

I\u2019ve found relief by stepping outside the human experience, by feeling how there are literally *zero* barriers between our so-called selves and everything else around us. I know this sounds like hogwash, but you have to realize that we\u2019re feeling this pain purely from our socially-constructed, artificial concepts of pain and loss. \n\nIt isnt a \u201closs\u201d of life, as much as it is a \u201ctransformation\u201d. Nature will continue to thrive long, long after we\u2019re gone. There will be a mind-blowing abundance of life in the distant future - the likes and the beauty of which we can\u2019t even fathom. Systems will reach new equilibria from which will emerge new relationships, new beings and hopefully more evolved neurobiology that does not prioritize short term pleasure over long-term growth. \n\nI know how awful this feels, and our nervous systems aren\u2019t meant to feel this much angst about the world falling apart around us. May that spur compassion for yourself, so that you don\u2019t burden yourself with additional guilt. Something that might also help is distancing yourself from the climate crisis and leaning  into what might instead be your own heart\u2019s calling - for me, it\u2019s ensuring I heal from generations of colonial/intergenerational trauma that not a single one of ancestors had the opportunity to. \n\nAgain, I know our biology stands in our way of deriving peace from this fact, but our demise is precisely *because* nature works so beautifully and always in balance. Take heart. The earth will be fine.",

Any time you see a Headline going \"THE WORLD IS ENDING AWFULLLYYYY OOHH GOD\" stop. Calm down. Read the actual science it's talking about. Newspapers don't disseminate knowledge - they sell papers. And studies have literally shown people who are scared and depressed are easier to control - and easier to sell things to. So keep that in mind, that this applies even to liberal leaning newspapers. \n\n2. Find a source of good news. Yes things are awful, but the world isn't some terrible blob of nothing good. Good things do happen. Finding good news sources can be a big help. jacobsimonsays on tiktok is a favorite of mine, but it helps to also have \"closer\" sources too. \n\n3. Figure out how you can help. It doesn't have to just be working on your small impact (though those are important too!). Be a voice against climate change. Look up ways you can encourage others around you. You'll feel less anxious if you feel you're taking steps towards progress and not stagnating. \n\n  \nI hope some of those help. I'm pushing my career towards fighting climate change, so I totally understand the anxiety, but I refuse to give in the fight.",

                "Content": "I have been in your shoes and related to a lot of what you said in this post. I was able to find work building technology for mitigating climate change and that helped for a while, but it also made me think about it more than was healthy for me, and was hard when I stopped believing the tech we were building was going to save the world. I still want to work in the field but thinking about how I can do it in a healthier way with my next job.\n\nI deep in my heart of hearts believe humans could solve this problem - a \\[report\\](https://www.llnl.gov/article/50686/new-analysis-outlines-national-opportunities-remove-co2-gigaton-scale) came out last year from the Department of Energy that said it would only cost us 0.5% of GDP to get to net-zero in the U.S. with technology that exists today. It is so frustrating to know that we could somewhat easily solve climate change but it is not a priority for people in power right now. I genuinely believe that will change with time and unfortunately from living through some of the things you are afraid of. But there is a brighter future eventually - for humanity and for you, if you choose it. You have to believe that.\n\nWorking on yourself can be helpful in times like this. I had a profound realization in the thick of what you are going through that was along the lines of \"the world as I see it in my head is inherently different from how the world actually is\". The real world is too complicated for us to truly comprehend so we form a simplified story in our brains. You have a lot of control over that story you tell yourself, and it is up to you if you want to have hope in there.\n\nYou should check out the work of Joanna Macy either through the book Active Hope or \\[this\\](https://resources.soundstrue.com/we-are-the-great-turning-podcast/) podcast that a student created with her before she died \\[EDIT: I guess she is still alive, but she's 95\\].\n\nI always remind myself always to take life a little less seriously, so I will tell you the same thing. It is crazy that we are just these sophisticated apes on a planet orbiting a sun floating in a sea of other suns. Nothing about our existence is logical.

And while you\u2019re wanting to address the symptoms, undoubtedly you\u2019d want to work on the causes too. There are careers out there that help in some small way (I became a global change scientist), and there is a place for us as consumers and volunteers as well - one person alone cannot make all the difference, and you shouldn\u2019t be taking on that responsibility, it\u2019s like signing up to become a puzzle piece. We only really matter insofar as we all make up the giant puzzle of climate action (and mutualistic action on biodiversity loss, poverty etc.)\u2026 if that analogy works! I\u2019d suggest to reflect on what your strengths are and where your talents lie, and see where that intersects with what needs to be done, whether on a professional or a personal or volunteer level. Read widely, educate yourself, speak to friends and family and strangers in a way that energizes (and doesn\u2019t guilt) them, get involved in opportunities, contribute in the ways that make the most sense to you. RE having kids, think about the value of raising a conscientious child, who can continue a legacy of climate action. That may even outweigh the additional footprint. Adoption is always an option, too (are your genes really that exceptional?). Above all, live true to your values, even if at times you feel like a lone voice in the wilderness.",

                "Content": "I wrote my undergrad dissertation on Punk and Cynicism in sense of the school of classical philosophy. I had a fantastic time writing it.\n\nI mention it because core to the philosophy is Parrhesia,  literally \"The Ability to Speak Freely\" but it especially means an ability to speak freely in that you're speaking uncomfortable truths to powerful people. Probably one of Diogenes' most famous examples of this in action was to tell Alexander the Great to stand out of his sun. This has been read a number of ways, but I take it that you can see the meaning in it.\n\nMy background is pretty specialised towards international climate politics, and one of the bits which I studied was how the structure of political bodies influences the effectiveness of their climate politics. I'm in the UK, and the UK especially post-Brexit under Conservative governments was dogshit for climate & environmental politics and its still pretty shit. In the summer of 2023 we backpeddled Hard on a bunch of climate commitments & expectations and I was practically glowing white-hot with rage at the news.\n\nThe point is; I get it. Politics and a want to fix the climate crisis is an exhausting field and pretty emotionally draining. You're entitled to take a personal day or take as much time as you want to feel better. But if you want to help with fixing the climate, the best thing you can do whilst remaining outside of a jail cell is holding your officials to account and chasing them on the commitments they've laid out. This isn't a \"go out & vote!\" comment because voting often doesn't change much quickly. Challenge your family & friends on climate stuff, especially if they're giving you vibes of \"voting conservative\" because Conservatives in their implicit policy endorsements Suck Shit for climate politics (small government doesn't work when you need Big Government to properly fund and and coordinate climate & environmental mitigation strategies). Go to conferences and hold the speakers to account with your questions. You have a voice and if you're shackled to hearing it all day then you might as well make it everyone else's problem. A burden shared is a burden halved. \n\nIf you want to pursue climate Stuff then I suggest you have a go and do that. Some courses are pretty affordable and I'm looking at getting certification to be a climate professional.\n\nMake no mistake, the ability for you to write this post has an implied level of privilege which means that you likely won't feel the worst effects of climate change for a while. But the solution to that isn't to be sad about it in bed, we all have moments when we need a break, but when you're back then the best you can do is redirect that grief into a different emotion. In my case I was Incredibly angry in 2023, you don't have to do the same. But be active and have those conversations. Depression isn't fun, but it's easier when you have friends which you're comfortable enough around to hang out with when you're feeling down.",

Not just for our own sake, but also for the sake of all the other inhabitants of this beautiful planet?\n\nAnd the thing is, it's not rational, it will never be rational. We are the product of powerful survival instincts gone awry. We have the intelligence and the means, but collectively we're just not very evolved, it would seem.\n\n Anyhooo... To answer you question, I don't think there's any one answer. I've cycled through many phases since my initial awareness of the fragility of the planet under siege by our increasing worldly demands. Sometimes you have to let go for your own sanity and focus on your immediate here and now.\n\nI recently lost my mother to dementia and before her, my father to cancer. I went through a combination of other life challenges this summer and had a legit breakdown of anxiety and depression that had me near letting go of my will do live. It was terrible. At first I was wanting to die, then I went through a phase of being terrified of death. Then, slowly but surely, I started enjoying the things in life I love most (music, friends, getting outside, movies etc) and bit by bit my lust for life came back to me. \n\nI'm not sure what happened exactly, but it seems like a lot of my deep fears (including eco-anxiety) just kinda cracked. It's not like my awareness has disappeared but I am now finding myself less swayed by the fears and sadness I've experienced in the past. Maybe seeing my parents go has forced me to really appreciate the preciousness of life. Now I want to focus on enjoying life as much as I can, while I can.\n\nI still hate to be part of this destructive species and I still do find it scary. But me hating it or not hating it isn't going to stop the ball that is already in motion. I'll do my part in any way that I can. I'll feel sadness, I'll feel fear, frustration, anger, despair... and also love, and joy, and holy shit it's still so incredible to be alive on this crazy messed up beautiful planet.",

I\u2019d love to find ways to make a meaningful\u00a0impact, maybe something measurable and actionable, rather than just hoping every change will add up.\n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in tracking my carbon footprint and maybe even offsetting emissions, but I don\u2019t know how to get access to quantities for consumers. I know offsets aren\u2019t a perfect fix, but I think supporting climate projects that actively reduce emissions is a step in the right direction. We\u2019re always going to emit some level of carbon, so getting closer to net-zero feels like a practical goal I can work\u00a0towards.\n\nAre there any apps, tools, or websites that help with this? Or ways to make sure I\u2019m supporting projects that truly make a difference?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what we can actually do to make a difference\u2014any tips or info would be amazing!",

                "Content": "The same thing that it's always been: reduce fossil fuel usage by refusing to engage in conspicuous consumption. \n\nYour carbon footprint is the money you spend and the money you spend is what makes rich people wealthy. If it weren't for our INSANE idea of what a normal life is supposed to look like (cars, fast fashion, eating any food from around the world at any time, being able to buy anything and have it immediately shipped to your door), we would be using rail to get to modestly paid jobs in a stable and sustainable economy. \n\nAdvertisers sold us the lie that we needed to devote our lives to things and we bought it so hard that we torched the planet. \n\nBut the part no one seems willing to do is to live with less or we'd see emissions go down in response. We'd also see the wealth of the owner class decline since their wealth is you giving them the money you work for to have what they're selling. \n\nPeople love to blame industry for climate change but if people stop buying the products, the industry responds by producing less. Instead, we're buying the new lie that industry can be great, it just needs batteries instead of oil, as if we can make a battery without burning oil. \n\nStop doing this. Stop buying what you're told because you're told it improves your life, start investing in people and community and find wealth in things that don't cost money. Walk, take trains, and bike to get around. Wear clothes until they're worn through and buy quality things you only need to get once over cheap things that need to be replaced. \n\nIt's so simple, it's hard to believe it's even a question. All the new cars on the road, electric or not, are climate change. This entire way of life demands oil be burned under us CONSTANTLY, including while we're sleeping. \n\nEverything we do that adds complexity to the world costs climate stability. When we reject the accumulation of wealth as a goal, we're doing the most anyone can do to not mess up the climate. \n\nBUT no one is willing to do that while their friends aren't and are having more fun as a result. Climate change is cultural FOMO, and \"green\" tech like EV's just pollute in other ways, especially tire particulate. \n\nIf EV's were going to put a dent in global emissions, how can we have fleets of them without our emissions even leveling off and instead setting new records every day? \n\nThe only thing any of us can do is turn our backs on consumption and learn to live with less, which is a very fulfilling life if you have a community to share it with. Instead, we're going to keep buying new crap, getting angry at the corporations we bought that crap from for the emissions they produced with our money and labor, and our emissions will only peak when the economy crashes and we can't have nice things anymore. This is backed up by the only times emissions ever slow down is during recessions. \n\nThere's no greening our way to sustainable industry. That's the fantasy big oil is selling and why they're so heavily invested in alternative energy. \n\nIn short, climate change is the sum of the decisions of a culture of greedy idiots who care more about buying new things than having a future, no matter how many batteries we make, and incremental increases in efficiency do exactly nothing to protect anything, in the same way that a poison that's 30% less toxic is still a poison. The only sensible thing is to stop buying poison but our collective response to that would be \"but we need poison\" or something equally dumb. We could each reduce our consumption by 80-90% without even touching necessities. \n\nI'll start believing in \"green technology\" when we stop setting records for fossil fuel consumption, habitat destruction, and emissions. Im not holding my breath.",

Learning to live in autonomy could be a really helpful habit to survive outside the industrial system (like without a car, without heat and supermarkets etc). \n\nBut those habits cannot represent the final goal. How can we be so sure that everybody is going to do the same? In addition to the situation's uncertainty, the changes in our day-to-day habits didn't change the world at all in history**.

                "Content": "**Scalable.** That's the keyword.\n\nIf the goal is to end climate change, there is currently only one real way for the individual to make a difference: To be the one who creates a system that will enforce large-scale habit changes in the population. Without such a system, the number of people going vegan, protesting capitalism, etc. will not be enough to stop the irreversible processes taking place right now. Personal sacrifices are, by themselves, not **scalable.**\n\nTo end climate change, we need to understand the causes behind it. We need to look at the processes and systems that produce the destructive greenhouse gas emissions. We need to understand why they exist, and why they endure in the face of all climate science combined.\n\nPolluting industries exist because the population requires their products. Luxury goods and services provide people with good emotions, which is a far more powerful motivator of everyday choices than the abstract idea of climate change. To maintain the flow of good emotions, the population elects grey politicians to keep the system running smoothly, instead of green politicians. The combined power of political support and profits makes the industry extremely powerful, giving it an effective license to destroy the ecosystem.\n\nThe established environmentalist movement thinks it's fighting the industry, when in reality it's fighting everyone. No wonder things are going badly.\n\nThe population's demand for polluting industry needs to change. Now, we've been fighting global warming for several decades, and it should be well established by now that facts and arguments aren't enough. We've tried it; it doesn't work. People have so many excuses, so many ways to distract themselves, so many ways to attack the messenger. It's in our nature to prioritize our own material benefit. A few people choose the environment when they learn about the stakes, but not enough to change the system that props up the industry. Ideas and arguments aren't **scalable**.\n\nChanging the demand requires something more powerful than facts and arguments. But not too powerful. Violent and illegal activism is too risky and costly for all but a few special individuals, and can thus easily be shut down by society. Radical activism isn't **scalable**.\n\nThere is, however, a third way: social pressure. You can interact with people on an emotional level, for much greater results. People will follow cues from the collective to decide their priorities. If you can effectively pose as the collective - as many have successfully done before you, just look at advertising - you can change people.\n\nWhat we're looking at here is a popular movement to protest individual over-consumption. You can start this right now. What you need is like-minded people who will join you, and a place to protest, preferably close to where people make their consumption decisions. No funds required. No political support needed. All you have to do is to keep at it for long enough that others will see the potential, and join you. When your movement becomes a silent, judging crowd at every shopping outlet, in every rich country, you will have created the system I described in my second paragraph. **A popular movement protesting individual over-consumption is scalable.**\n\nThat is how climate change ends.\n\n(if you want more arguments, and are curious about the economical aspects, I've assembled my ideas at a small site: [Filling the solution void](https://konsumogklima.no))",

Which is obviously not true, so an individual person has impact. Everything that every single person does matters for the climate.\n\nAnd everyone taking these actions doesn't need to be coordinated, it just takes individual consumers to take these steps and the market will naturally respond. Airlines will cut down the number of flights offered and clothing factories will produce less and less meat will be processed. That's basic supply and demand, and happens every day *without coordination* as a response to billions of consumer choices.\n\nIndividual action **does** **cause** collective action; there is not collective action without many individual actions. This is like saying that drops of water do not cause a flood because they are small. But of course we know that there cannot be a flood without drops of water.",

        "Content": "  \n\n\nThroughout high school, I always felt a stronger pull toward the environment than most of my friends. It wasn\u2019t like I did endless research or deep dives, but I couldn\u2019t ignore how strongly I felt. I always envisioned climate change as more than just an issue\u2014it was a battle, a righteous struggle for the planet. Yet, every time I looked around, the enthusiasm seemed hollow.\n\nThe news would break about new agreements or technological breakthroughs, but then everything went quiet. No real follow-up, just more depressing predictions hidden behind scientific jargon\u2014like AR6\u2014offering a view of the future that felt bleak. What frustrated me more was the hypocrisy. The kids in environmental clubs would talk passionately about recycling and the dangers of plastic, but you\u2019d catch them throwing everything into one trash bin or ordering products wrapped in layers of bubble wrap. And yeah, I\u2019m guilty of it too. I care about the environment, but I still take plastic cups when I eat out because they feel cleaner. I still take fresh A4 paper when I could easily use the back of old sheets.\n\nWhat troubled me wasn\u2019t just the individual actions\u2014it was the bigger picture. The world leaders, the influencers, the UN SecGen, all saying how urgent climate change was, but nothing really changed. Maybe it was a matter of time for those ideas to trickle down, but time is one thing we don\u2019t have. As a Specialized English student in Vietnam, I was supposed to look up to these figures, absorb their speeches, and parrot their words to others. But I started to ask myself: For what? To raise awareness? To motivate? Or just to impress with fancy quotes?\n\nFor context, Specialized English is a program for gifted students here, where we focus on one subject intensively\u2014English. It\u2019s meant to set us apart, make us excel. I did well. Academic prizes, fluency in English, and career paths in ELT or business seemed like obvious choices. But I started to feel like something was missing. Was it enough to be good at something that didn\u2019t address what really mattered?\n\nSo, when I had to make a choice between high school and college, I decided to do something radical. I walked away from the identity I\u2019d built\u2014the awards, the comfort of easy career options\u2014and chose *engineering*. Specifically, *Sustainable Process Engineering*, the first program of its kind in Vietnam.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy choice. I didn\u2019t come from a science-heavy background, so jumping into engineering felt like starting from scratch. Some days, I still don\u2019t feel like I belong here. I doubt my abilities and struggle with imposter syndrome. But I know this is where I need to be. This is real. This is where change happens.\n\nEngineering is more than talking about change. It\u2019s about understanding how systems work and how we can fix them. It\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m overwhelmed at times, wondering if I\u2019m doing enough. But I tell myself this is the fight that matters, the one that requires all of us, no matter how uncertain we feel.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be seen as some sort of leader right now. I\u2019m just someone who\u2019s starting to figure it out, struggling like the rest of us. I\u2019m not pretending to have all the answers\u2014I\u2019m just a willing member in this fight, learning and growing every day.\n\nI trust the rationalities of communities like r/collapse, where people lay out the grim realities of the future based on scientific data. But I also have the faith of r/OptimistsUnite, believing that change is still possible and that together we can make a difference. It\u2019s not just about facts; it\u2019s about people coming together to find solutions. I hold both the rational, somber truth and the hopeful belief that things can improve, because both perspectives drive action.\n\nIf you're working on something real, if you're actively making a difference, I want to connect. I\u2019ve found hope in communities like r/ClimateActionPlan, r/Doers, and r/OptimistsUnite. They remind me that it\u2019s possible to hold both the weight of reality and the power of hope in your hands.\n\nEven if you're not in Ho Chi Minh City, we can still connect. I\u2019d love to contribute my opinions, thinking, and skills to your activities in foreign lands over the internet. And if you're in or near HCMC, I would love to talk one day.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Hell, include this in your task list if they buy a lot of cheap items that break down, also from them. \n\nAmazon as an affordable source is not a bad thing for a family to need.\n\nBut, the resellers can sell sketchy/cheap/breakable items \u2013 talk about it. \n\nThe labour practices and union busting from this company deny human dignity \u2013\u00a0talk about it.\n\nAn uncountable fleet of gig workers piloting non-standardized vehicles affects the environment and our road safety, especially because each gig worker's job is at risk based on cut throat delivery time limits. For example, it's not like a Amazon is insisting on a fleet of standardized electric vehicles, meanwhile DHL has made this investment. Talk about it.\n\nAnd have alternatives ready, as an approach.\n\nMaybe source a local business that offers a comparable product that will last longer. The spend may be X dollars more, but if your experience is that the product lasts more than a year, recommend it.\n\nRemind folks of any department stores or warehouse stores in your city or town that can be accessed by bike or transit, to pickup goods themselves rather than contribute to the next-day-delivery pollution fleet.\n\nAll of this as a lifestyle change forces the buyer to really consider whether purchasing casually and off-handedly is worth it (i.e. I have to pay more for it, it's not broken so I don't need another, I have to travel to it myself so is this really needed).\n\n  \nTL;DR Talk about Amazon shopping addiction when you see it.

It should be clear by now that just providing people with information isn't enough to shift most people's habits. People consume because it gives them positive emotions, so we need to create counter-emotions. \n\nThe industry is slow and powerful, and we'll never be enough activists to stop it directly. Individuals, however, are susceptible to being influenced by other humans, particularly groups.\n\nA large popular movement against individual over-consumption would do more than just send a message. It would change the entire game, forcing for-waste industries out of business, cutting emissions, land use, energy consumption, making an instant impact and difference.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that individual sacrifices of climate-aware people are wasted unless they are part of a large-scale system to make a great number of people make the same sacrifices. That system does, as of now, not exist. But I think it can be created.\n\nI've made a small [site](https://konsumogklima.no) exploring these ideas in more detail, if you're interested in the concept.",

                "Content": "We're coming up with more and more ways to synthetically make stuff that can be used to offset or replace huge GHG emitting sectors of the economy!\n\nFor example: cemet & concrete manufacturing is responsible for 8% of global emissions. This is because for the last several centuries, we've just taken limestone rocks (aka calcium carbonate) and heated them in a fossil-fired kilns to \"boil off\" the carbon from the limestone to produce quicklime (aka calcium oxide), the key ingredient that makes cement harden into concrete when water is added.\n\nA Boston based company has invented a way to electrolytically extract calcium from silica and alumina formations, avoiding the carbon emissions from firing a kiln and from converting limestone. Using silicas as the source material us great because these materials don't contain carbon in the first place. The end product is identical to the original cement recipe. The functional end-use (ie: buildings, bridges, roads) is marginal to total cost, increasing construction costs by a few percentage points.\n\nGovernment entities buy roughly 50% of the cement consumed in the US, which means there's an opportunity to use that outsized purchasing power to shift the cement market by demanding low-carbon cement",

Oil is being produced at its marginal breakeven price, meaning oil companies are making very little money on a per unit basis. This means that they are differing maintenance and not investing in new infrastructure, so even if the US president elect does reopen federal lands to drilling as promised, it's unlikely that much exploitation will occur since there's little money to be made. Also, the differed maintenance and lack of investment in oil's future means that oil should be on its way out; as critical stuff breaks, it won't get repaired or replaced. Many major oil executives have said that they don't want to continue to sink cash into oil exploration because they don't want to be left holding a stranded asset as the world inexorably shifts away from using oil. So since stuff isn't getting repaired and replaced and since we're not going to be drilling new wells, oil extraction should start to sunset soon!",

        "Content": "I\u2019m a student looking at the relationships between leadership and climate change and am feeling a bit frustrated with the futility and navel-gazing of some of the research in the social science/ climate change space.\u00a0\n\nA lot of the research seems to be catered for an elite (e.g. how willing are flood victims to pay tax for climate mitigation?) rather than getting to the real root of the problem (e.g. how can fossil fuel companies be made to pay tax for their harmful externalities?).\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a small pit of dread in my stomach that I\u2019m part of the problem. Any research I do on the matter now will likely not be published for another 1-2 years, and will then most likely sit behind a paywall and only accessed by people who are already concerned anyway. And as we know, there's not a lot of time left.\n\nReflecting on what I\u2019ve been reading the last few months, this is what I think an effective climate mitigation campaign targeting leaders of corporations could look like:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create a \u201ccarbon tracker\u201d that targets the top 1000 or so people whose decisions are most paramount to climate mitigation. This could include CEOs/ CFOs of major corporations, the board members of these corporations, and institutional investors. It would be a bit like the infamous BP carbon tracker that put the onus on individuals to change their behaviours, instead illustrating how the decisions these people do/ don\u2019t make could impact the amount of ghg produced and consequent global temperatures. It would help remove some of the ambiguity some of these people may feel about their role and responsibility in the climate crisis.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research suggests that many investment decisions are guided by emotions. For example, investors may be more likely to have disproportionate investments in companies from their hometown. Use emotions to increase the salience of the climate crisis for leaders. Create pictures of what the conditions in their hometowns would be like under different emissions scenarios. Bring these images to their attention by placing them in ads that appear when they search for their name.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then create a \u201cgolden bridge\u201d for these leaders, with a website or somesuch outlining the choices available to them that could best help mitigate the climate crisis. Examples could include stopping quarterly earning reports to better focus on long-term goals, committing to an evidence-based zero emissions pathway, creating sustainability units that have oversight over/interact with every area of their business.\n\nWould be great to have a network of committed citizen researchers/ software engineers who could work on these strategies and ones like them. It could be called \u201cBetter Angels\u201d or BA for short. Or could it be picked up/ driven by an environmental org? I have no organising experience/ no idea where to start. What do you think?\n\n",

I'll say some banal other things, having been in your shoes when I was younger.\n\n\\- Implementing these ideas will take lots of work. There's no shortcut or magic bullet, you just have to start implementing them. It's not easy, those ads will be expensive.\n\n\\- Yes, many other major environmental organizations also want to influence the opinions of world leaders and high value individuals whose decisions have a major impact on climate change. You should probably assume the people you're thinking of have already been contacted or had discussions with such organizations. I'm sorry. The ads thing is modestly novel, but the high-level playbook isn't.\n\n\\- I suggest that you're more likely to have success organizing at lower levels, or by contributing to an established group.   This is also hard. The groups have limited budgets and don't always see the point in having another staff member. The organized groups already working on this, though, have people who know how to design websites, run ads, and access to funds. They may tell you that they've already tried your idea. So you can try to go your own way, god bless. \n\n\\- It's fair to question the meaning of climate research as a direct push to reduce C02 emissions or climate change. Your instinct to try to move to advocacy instead is sound. You're looking at an extremely hard problem. You're right to find a way to try to engage in persuasion of your fellow citizens.

It talks about how he invited the heads of fossil fuel corporations to the Vatican and actually seemed to persuade one leader to shift their business model, God bless. It seems like a lot of pressure is perhaps applied to CEOs but less to the shareholders and board members who decide what the CEO\u2019s pay packages look like and whether they should stay in their roles. The literature I\u2019ve read suggests that in the rare instances when leaders try and implement green strategy they\u2019re worn down over time by group members who are dissatisfied with anything they believe could challenge a company\u2019s imperative to accumulate capital. Perhaps if we brought these background figures into the spotlight a bit more they\u2019d feel more responsibility to support actions that mitigate the climate crisis. Given, there are probably a few thousand of these types of people which may be difficult for under-resourced NFPs to track, which is why a Wikipedia-esque research community could be helpful.\n\nReading your last points it sounds like the next step will be to reach out to established groups about the idea and see their interest.

While it might be tempting to write off these leaders as callous tyrants, this approach might not be most conducive to creating the urgent change we need.\n\nChristopher Voss, a former top FBI negotiator, argues that one of the most effective ways to persuade someone is through empathy (he didn\u2019t care much for the criminals he dealt with, but he finds this approach to be the most practical/ effective). \u00a0The literature on leader decision-making is full of examples of how emotions can/ are impacting leadership behaviour. In China, leaders are less likely to make big decisions if the year is their Zodiac sign. Leaders are less likely to make risky choices if they\u2019ve recently experienced a death in their family. CEOs who are close to retirement/ have a lot of stock in the company are less likely to make any decisions that could decrease this stock value- interesting when we consider how much of Elon\u2019s wealth is tied up in Tesla and how his support of Trump seemed a bit unexpected to people who viewed him as a climate savant. If we better understand what leaders pay attention to when they make decisions and work to better influence this, perhaps there\u2019s opportunity to create change.\u00a0",

I hope that will change in the future, and we can get a more robust public transportation system in the US that isn\u2019t comprised of a few buses here and there or subways in a handful of cities. \n\nLuckily the USHR is leading the charge on this front and advocating for advancement of US rail. I made a post about them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/s/RfTiFzfNWn\n\nI took an Amtrak from Atlanta to DC and I can tell you that we have a lot of catching up to do compared to what they have in other countries. It was slow, bumpy, and very expensive. I ended up paying $400 for a 16 hour ride in an overnight train car. For context, that is about the same as going from Warsaw, Poland to Frankfurt, Germany. That trip is only 10 hours and almost the price.\n\nDonate here: https://ushsr.org/ushsr/donate.html\n\nThanks for helping to bring high-speed rail to the US!",

Upgrade bottlenecks on the NEC for slight speed improvement, but primarily capacity and reliability upgrades. Think 5 min time savings, no bridge lifts, and additional trains per hour. \n\n2. Upgrades to 110 mph on proven routes, right now it's Chi-STL and Chi-Det, they should be doing the same thing in their other top routes. \n\n3. More service on proven corridors, as they've done in NC, Cascades and are working to do on the Hiawatha\n\n4. Add more trains on smaller sections of LD services, the Borealis has worked really well, they should be doing the same Chicago to Cleveland, San Antonio to NO ect. \n\n5. Add new mid distance routes like the ones identified in the  Id program\n\nHigh speed rail is a pipe dream unless backed by private partnerships/the state of California in a few specific corridors. It's simply too expensive without massive political backing which isn't present at the moment. Let's get the routes we have to be 20% faster than driving to build a base, then go after the expensive upgrades.",

Expansion of Amtrak is something we should certainly be supporting, and I should\u2019ve mentioned normal rail as something to support in my first comment, but I don\u2019t feel that focusing on high speed rail is a good expense at this time.",

Once that's done, electrification and curve straightening are the main things standing in the way of treating that segment as basically a southern extension of the NEC.

                "Content": "I agree on some of those, but something like Vegas to Denver seems pretty tough to fund/build. LA to Vegas is supposed to happen by 2028ish iirc, but from there I don\u2019t see a reasonable path forward. You would realistically either cut through the Rocky Mountains, or go up to SLC and south/east from there on the Moffat Tunnel. I don\u2019t really see a way that could be made high speed, and the better solution imo would be running up to SLC and transferring to Amtrak, at least to Denver. After Denver, the Zephyr (Amtrak) goes 80 most of the way and I\u2019d think high speed anywhere east of Denver would be a long, long ways down the road because of that. I would much rather have a focus on connecting close cities and urban corridors, like Pueblo, CO to Cheyenne, WY as a local one I\u2019ve been hoping for, and connect those via Amtrak rather than trying to do something like Denver to KC anytime soon.\n\nAnother big thing is ridership; Denver to KC would get nowhere near as many riders as the Pueblo to Cheyenne I mentioned. If we focused on shorter distance, high-ridership lines like that, and also focus on making rail more accessible and favorable to people in those cities, I feel that\u2019ll be way more productive than trying to implement high-speed cross-country lines. If people do want to go cross-country, Amtrak isn\u2019t all that bad.\n\nBy the way, the Chicago to KC Amtrak with a stop in STL takes about eleven hours, and I think that one goes upwards of 100mph at times, so I bet that would be very low priority as well.",

Amtrak has gotten funding recently to start some new projects/routes, ~~but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll all be terminated under the new administration~~ but it still won\u2019t be high speed. The only place high-speed rail works is the northeast, where Amtrak owns the rails and has it all electrified; everywhere else they operate on foreign tracks. Planes are, and likely always will be, the fastest way to travel long distance, and the car-dependence of cities is hard to change.

                "Content": "The other replies here are not off the mark; there are hurdles to high speed rail that are generally: land use policy favors roads and sprawling homes, rail companies are prevented from owning land for railways (even when they did in the 1800s there were all sorts of limits to the railroad owning and controlling huge land tracts). Transit oriented development (good transit connected to services and housing) is the only somewhat sustainable form of development but it is a new concept because a lot of US land is cheap and a slight majority of people prefer sprawl. But huge energy is growing around walkable cities and communities. \n\nWhat I am not seeing in the comments is a huge problem: lack of political will. Popular support makes anything \u2014 good or bad \u2014 come to fruition. The first time the country was connected by rail it was a massive investment with somewhat decent buy in, unlike cars which were never in super high demand and had to be heavily marketed and subsidized. That is what we are up against: cars and complacency. So we have to highlight the positives of trains whenever possible and shift the perception. \n\nHow do we shift the narrative? Make the hurdles to HSR seem surmountable - which they are. HSR is not a scam or pipe dream, there are challenges but they are not at all unique to the US. Emphasize how pleasant rail is compared to car/plane travel. Look into local groups already advocating for rail, those are sure to exist. I think attending local planning meetings can help to challenge car-centric infrastructure and promote safe, clean, reliable, affordable mass transit. Sprawl is a scam, it degrades fast, is expensive, makes people unhealthy and disconnected, and generally kills the environment. Density is a big part of rail too - can\u2019t have good station placement if a stop is just a bare bones bench with no services or reason to live or stop there. \n\nA rail non-profit or advocacy group is a good idea! Maybe you can start one lol. I\u2019m sure a lot of us would be on board! \ud83d\ude85 (edited for typos)",

                "Content": "There is some progress, but it takes a long time to work out the planning, land rights, city agreements, funding, and everything else.  California approved high speed rail plan in the late 2000's, for example, between LA and San Francisco (the state created a committee to study and plan the project in 1996, when they created the California High Speed Rail Authority, but the plan itself didn't go to voters until 2008).  They have spent the last 16 years getting the project plan off the ground, as construction is not exactly straightforward and sometimes has issues along the routes.  Sometimes, for example, areas need to reroute roads or build bridges for existing traffic to bypass those new rail tracks.  There are currently [119 miles of track built](https://www.buildhsr.com/) or under construction, most of which is almost complete between Fresno and Bakersfield, but the project is still in progress.  Currently, only this one section is slated to be complete by 2028 - 20 years after the initial vote.\n\nThere are also [a few other projects](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/04/29/the-state-of-high-speed-rail-projects-in-the-us-infographic/) in development right now, but construction is slow. This includes The Northeast, Northwest, Texas, and Las Vegas.  The main issue seems to be funding.  Building all that infrastructure takes a lot of money up-front.  The article goes a little more into the details.\n\nThe Biden administration has plans to update the rail systems in the northeast to HSR, or otherwise construct separate rail lines, but that is still in its infancy.  This project [started only a few years ago](https://www.hsrail.org/regions/) with the Inflation Reduction Act.  I assume this will stay on-track for now, unless there is a shift in focus over time.\n\nedit: I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITYgCJcD2o) that gives an overview of HSR in America today (this is from January 2024). They mention preliminary routes in Atlanta-Charlotte, Texas, and Portland-Seattle-Vancouver, along with the ones I mentioned above.",

You would at least have to omit the flyover states. That being said, there are spans of densely populated areas where it would be very practical, such as the entire East Coast. Considering how much it costs to build a railway, and the fact that it would have to cross private properties of thousands of individuals requiring the use of eminent domain, it would pretty much have to be a project driven by the federal government. This means that it would have to overcome partisan politics, political agendas, and lobbyists groups that don't want it to happen. I would love this since I find airports and airlines to be a pain in the ass, but I don't think it will happen due to the obstacles I just mentioned.",

It would be a daunting task to repeat what was done with our Interstate Highway system and high speed rail is far more expensive.\n\nIt isn't just the cost of the rail it is the infrastructure to bring it into population hubs.  Some cities do, a lot do not.  Again, billions and billions, property acquisition and the not in my back yard cry.  \n\nNIMBY.  Look at how hard it is to build new electrical transmission lines within States.  As soon as one is proposed they are immediately in court by landowners and concerned groups who don't want them in their area.  \n\nWe want to use electricity to power our grid.  Building wind turbines and solar panels uses lots of rare and not so rare metals.  In the United States it is becoming almost impossible to open a hard metal mine.

So maybe optional meetings weekly, with the general one once every 2 weeks or month? \n\nThe hard part is building up a system for choosing the next leader because in student organizing many times the organization just dies off because they lose the charismatic leader. So just keep that in mind before graduating.\n\nIf people are excited about projects, that can help build up the organization, but keep in mind it often isn't that impactful in terms of systemic-wide improvement.  \n  \n Getting your school district to commit to a climate action plan is. Having them pass resolution so each school has those projects/funds it, is a systemic improvement. Murals are really dope tho too.",

The TLDR is something like:\n\n* Mitigating climate change is important, but apocalyptic prognostications are overstated\n* Fighting domestic fossil fuel projects doesn't cut emissions, but it does cause economic and political harms\n* Environmentalists who oppose development-based solutions are acting counterproductively and should be ignored \n* Focus should be placed on developing and deploying clean technologies, especially where costs are negative or very low\n\nI think I generally agree with this take, except:\n\n1. The impacts of climate change, while not apocalyptic, will be devastating enough to call for incurring significant short-term costs now to mitigate them\n2. The climate doesn't care how many solar panels we put up. What matters is cutting emissions.\n\nYglesias is correct about the ineffectiveness of fighting domestic fossil fuel projects. The fuels instead come from somewhere else, prices go up, and the people vote in a climate denier next election. \n\nThe problem is, I don't know where the effective solution actually lies. The climate movement has been trying to convince the broader public to care for decades now and, in many countries at least, carbon taxes, divestment, and any other measure that might cause a smidge of short-term economic pain are still political losers.\n\nThoughts?\n\nP.s. if you don't like Matt Yglesias, that's fine.

This will devastate many island nations and do serious damage to coastal cities and infrastructure where billions of people live. Appocalyptic prognostications are overstated but the reality is also going to kill tens of millions.\n\n2. Of course it does, this is our major goal we must stop the fossil fuel industry from continuing to expand it must be phased out in a controlled way. Otherwise, we will see it collapse horrifically when the fossil fuel era finally comes to an end. And it must come to an end sooner rather than later. There are two options we end domestic fossil fuel production in a slow controlled decline, or millions die and the fossil fuel industries come to a catatrophic end. There is no future for the fossil fuel industries. Gas and fracked gas industry produces very few jobs and is not worth protecting.\n\n3. Yeah, maybe, but its not always environmentalists, you also tend to have locals that are against it for NMBY reasons. If we don't work with the locals it produces backlash and slows down the process even more than just talking with them to begin with.\n\n4.

                "Content": "No, the argument is defeatist and bad. As you said yourself, emissions must fall. For emissions to fall, FF emitters must be shut down, end of story. This has happened in the EU, it's happened here. It is in no way impossible, that's a fact. It needs to keep happening.\n\nPolitical limitations exist, but your argument that \"sometimes political efforts to reduce FF fail, or get rolled back, therefore further efforts are a waste of time...\" myopic. Implies \"ff emissions cannot fall\", which is empirically false.  The fight against slavery went on for at least 200 years; the fight for women's equality for hundreds and is obviously not over, but continues to progress. The fight is never going to end, we're never going to completely win, but climate change will continue to get worse, until we all die, or until we slow it down enough to survive. (\"Apocalyptic outcomes overstated\"...ok what artificial upper bound are you putting on the temporal axis... because there's no upper bound on temperature)\n\nI will further add that a major impediment to FF reduction in *every* nation is the fear of economic undercutting from other nations who don't play ball. Refusing to cut FF emissions here is a strong impediment to cutting in foreign countries.\n\nI don't see any underlying depth to your argument, only an extrapolation from some particular recent setback in one time or place into a universal law.  There will be more setbacks, and obviously one can't unilaterally cancel the living standards of the masses sustainably in a democracy. Fortunately, that's not necessary. \n\nClean energy is important, but it doesn't shut down FF emitters. What we are seeing in America, today, is growth in total energy consumption at a pace equaling clean energy deployment, leading to stagnant FF emissions.  That's not going to change without a fight, a fight to force FF emitters to shut down as clean sources come online, and hold down total demand growth. You can personally choose to fight, or you can choose to give up, and argue for things that are easier and more popular but don't actually help. Much like the person you quote.",

                "Content": "That's a lot of nonsense, starting with your first claim. You don't know what pollution is, but it certainly includes an excess of co2, ie: '**pollution**, the addition of any substance ([solid](https://www.britannica.com/science/solid-state-of-matter),\u00a0[liquid](https://www.britannica.com/science/liquid-state-of-matter), or\u00a0[gas](https://www.britannica.com/science/gas-state-of-matter)) or any form of\u00a0[energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/energy)\u00a0(such as\u00a0[heat](https://www.britannica.com/science/heat), sound, or\u00a0[radioactivity](https://www.britannica.com/science/radioactivity)) to the\u00a0[environment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment)\u00a0at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form.'

A potent heat-trapping gas released in ever-greater quantities each year traps ever more gas, predictably enough. The scientific consensus on this grows stronger every year, as you can read in any serious study, such as the IPCC Assessments. If you're not serious, keep relying on amateur nonsense like the second paper, written by someone listed as 'retired' and another listed as 'independent researcher.' \n\nThe 'global problem' is that we're rapidly acidifying the oceans and returning the global climate to where it was the last time co2 levels were this high - which was three million years ago, long before homo sapiens existed, and when sea levels were tens of metres higher.

                "Content": "You have a misunderstanding of how CO\u2082 works, particularly radiative transfer and the role of convection in heat redistribution. CO\u2082 absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation, reducing the amount of heat escaping directly to space from certain wavelengths. Observations of increased OLR as CO\u2082 levels rise are not contradictory; they reflect a warmer surface emitting more infrared radiation due to the greenhouse effect. The increased OLR occurs in different spectral bands not absorbed by CO\u2082, whereas CO\u2082 continues to trap heat in its specific absorption bands, confirmed through spectral analysis.\n\nSatellite measurements show reduced outgoing radiation at CO\u2082 absorption bands (15 \u00b5m) and increased radiation at other wavelengths, consistent with greenhouse gas theory. [directly observed](https://www.nature.com/articles/35066553) changes in Earth\u2019s radiation spectrum over time, confirming the role of CO\u2082 in reducing energy loss in its absorption bands.\n\nIn the troposphere, CO\u2082 absorbs heat and transfers it to neighboring air molecules through collisions, increasing the overall thermal energy (temperature) of the atmosphere. This warming is distributed by conduction and convection, which amplify greenhouse warming. While individual CO\u2082 molecules may not always re-emit photons, the bulk of CO\u2082 in the atmosphere collectively contributes to a net increase in downward longwave radiation, measurable at the Earth\u2019s surface, using instruments like pyrgeometers.\n\nWhile OLR increases with rising temperatures (a result of more heat being emitted at the Earth\u2019s surface), CO\u2082 restricts energy loss in its specific absorption bands, requiring the surface and lower atmosphere to warm further to achieve radiative balance with space. The Earth\u2019s radiative imbalance (more energy absorbed than emitted) is measured directly by satellites (e.g., NASA\u2019s CERES program) and ocean heat content observations, both showing a warming Earth consistent with CO\u2082-induced forcing \n\nAs CO\u2082 increases, the troposphere warms due to heat trapping, while the stratosphere cools. This occurs because CO\u2082 in the stratosphere radiates heat more efficiently into space, a prediction unique to greenhouse gas warming that has been consistently observed in satellite data.\n\nStudies have [confirmed cooling in the stratosphere alongside warming in the troposphere](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1999RG000065), aligning with what we expect from AGW. On a global scale, LWdn has been observed to increase with rising greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to surface warming. \n\n[Total solar irradiance has gone down](https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/14/is-the-sun-causing-global-warming/) in the last few decades. It does not explain the warming we have been seeing",

                "Content": "Thank you for the substantive response.\n\n>  \nyour argument that \"sometimes political efforts to reduce FF fail, or get rolled back, therefore further efforts are a waste of time...\"\u00a0\n\nThat is not my argument. My argument is that much of the climate movement's efforts are focused on issues that have no direct impact on emissions but do have a negative impact on politics, creating an indirect negative impact on emissions. \n\nIn the U.S., environmental groups spent a lot of political capital opposing oil and gas, and it was effective insofar as the Biden administration tried to reduce domestic production. But then Russia invaded Ukraine, prices spiked, Biden's approval tanked, the Dems did a 180\u00ba on fracking, and the U.S. cranked production up higher than any other country in history. At no point were emissions affected at all, and the American people, cranky about prices at the pump, voted in a lunatic who has declared war on the climate.\n\nThe point is that even though fossil fuel production went up under Biden, it's obvious that Trump's election is bad news for the climate. Biden did do a lot of good for the climate, but not when he was trying to shut down domestic production. Of course, the ultimate goal is to get to a place where no fossil fuel production is needed, but at this stage it seems like the wrong thread to pull at.\n\n>what artificial upper bound are you putting on the temporal axis... because there's no upper bound on temperature)\n\nModels get less and less useful the further into the future they forecast. Most reputable sources focus on 2100, and that seems reasonable to me. There is more than enough to worry about in that window to lose sleep over the uncertainties of the next century.\n\n>Refusing to cut FF emissions here is a strong impediment to cutting in foreign countries.\n\n>\n\nAgreed. Which is why it's important to ensure that we don't blow our political capital on efforts that don't reduce emissions but do help get climate deniers elected.\n\n>That's not going to change without a fight, a fight to force FF emitters to shut down as clean sources come online, and hold down total demand growth.\n\nI agree, but we have to focus our efforts on the actors that make sense. For instance, a project that drove a coal power plant offline and replaced it with a clean option would actually cut emissions. Shutting down the local coal mine would not because the plant would just keep burning coal it got from somewhere else.",

                "Content": "What a hilarious joke this is my friend. More nonsense from your lack of scientific understanding. \n\nTwo things you are hilariously missing:\n\n1) carbon sequestration does not in any way require combustion. Some methods use it as you describe, but others don\u2019t. You seem to be thinking of BECCS, but that\u2019s not the only way carbon sequestration works. For example, there is mineralization, which sequesters CO2 without any oxygen from the atmosphere whatsoever. Basically, you are ignorant and uninformed about how sequestration works, and you think your limited understanding is the totality of carbon sequestration. \n\n2) Even if we assume the only form of carbon sequestration in existence is BECCS, it\u2019s impossible to burn so much material that we remove all the O2 from the atmosphere, as there are not enough fuels to do so. You seem to hilariously forget that we are also removing CO2 from the atmosphere in BECCS, which is ironic and funny, because that\u2019s, ya know, the whole point. Way to miss the whole point. As BECCS removes CO2 from the atmosphere, it actually **does not change** the concentration of O2 in the atmosphere. Remember how photosynthesis works from high school? Plants breathe in CO2, harvest the carbon from it by a long series of reactions, which eventually also releases the O2 **back into the air while the plant is alive**. If we chop down that tree and burn it, the O2 it releases during its life gets **recaptured** by the combustion. The burning of the wood, based on the basic laws of physics, cannot require more oxygen than the tree produced as it grew. \n\nWith the main points out of the way, now it\u2019s time for the bonus round! If we combine both of the main scientific points together, we get a hilarious irony about this whole post, which is a great laugh for any environmental or remotely scientific minded person reading this: \n\nBonus demolition) There is a carbon sequestration solution which also uses biomass from trees, but unlike BECCS, doesn\u2019t involve any combustion. The solution is to cut trees down, and burry them. No combustion, just burry the wood unburnt. If the wood is able to decay in an oxygenated environment, then it will just re-release the CO2 it absorbed in its lifetime and re-absorb all the O2 it released in its lifetime as a result of the decay reactions. However, burring things underground in the right soil types can be an unoxygenated environment, and in that case the tree can stay down there and keep its carbon down there too. So not only is this a form of carbon sequestration you seem to be ignorant of, it is not just O2 neutral like BECCS, it actually **increases** the concentration of O2 in the atmosphere as we decrease the concentration of CO2. \n\nLove to hear your response.",

        "Created": "2024-11-23 13:48:48",
        "Content": "Given the disastrous consequences likely to arise from the recent election in the USA, I began reflecting on the value of democracy and its ability to address the challenges that climate change poses to the world. Based on the arguments presented in a book I read not long ago, I decided to write these thoughts on the state of democracy and climate change globally.\n\nThe book Can Democracy Handle Climate Change by Daniel Fiorino defends democracy as the best system to tackle climate change. Among the arguments Fiorino provides to support his stance are greater access to environmental information in democracies, stronger institutional frameworks, checks and balances at the state level in federal systems, greater openness to international negotiations, increased capacity for innovation, the ability to attract individuals/voters with diverse interests, and better climate indicators.\n\nHowever, I believe Fiorino\u2019s analysis contains two significant flaws. First, it assumes there is a \u201cmargin of error,\u201d meaning voters might \u201cmake mistakes\u201d by electing candidates who do not believe in climate change, yet this would not undermine the suitability of democracy as a system to address the climate crisis. The truth is, there is no longer any margin for error; we cannot afford mistakes, as each year without measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change will have severe consequences.\n\nSecond, the author focuses the discussion primarily on the contrast between democratic and authoritarian regimes. I believe the real question should be how subject to democratic or judicial oversight climate regulations ought to be, how technical they should be, and how binding. In principle, it is conceivable to have an autonomous technical body making regulatory decisions on climate issues in an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d manner within a democracy. But the question is whether that model is desirable (beyond the practical challenges of garnering sufficient support to establish such a body).\n\nRegarding Fiorino\u2019s arguments, I think some are not necessarily exclusive to democratic regimes, while others are \u201cdouble-edged swords.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the influence of major corporations and economic groups is undeniable. In the 2024 U.S. election, the world\u2019s richest man aligned with the climate change-denying candidate, using his platforms to spread false information and attack the opposing campaign. Major oil companies have ample resources and motivation to support denialist candidates who will allow their businesses to continue operating for as long as possible, regardless of the consequences. Ordinary citizens concerned about climate change will never achieve that level of influence.\n\nIn the effort to appeal to a broad range of voters, climate interests are often overshadowed by more immediate concerns (which are not necessarily less relevant but can ultimately be detrimental or even incompatible with ambitious climate action).\n\nRegarding strong institutions, these are not inherently exclusive to democratic countries. For instance, it will be interesting to observe China\u2019s development in this area. On the other hand, democratic institutions appear increasingly weak and unstable as populist leaders and parties gain popularity and power, even in developed nations.\n\nThis trend toward populist leaders is one of the main arguments against democracy. Although it is impossible to predict voter behavior with certainty, it is likely that the trend toward populism will persist and even intensify due to climate change. Scarcity of basic resources like water and food will drive massive waves of migration as parts of the world become uninhabitable. This scarcity is also likely to lead to more international conflicts and an arms race, while nationalist sentiments grow stronger, complicating international cooperation.\n\nAt the international level, despite the existence of numerous treaties, unless their provisions can be effectively enforced, they cannot be considered viable solutions. The world already bears the failure of Kyoto, and if states and their elected leaders decide to stop complying with the Paris Agreement (as the U.S. president-elect intends to do), we are heading toward another failure in international climate law.\n\nVoters are currently exposed to massive amounts of information, much of which is false. Today, more than ever, voters are susceptible to falling for lies propagated on social media without any oversight. This also fuels large-scale conspiracies, which more people believe without fact-checking. As a result, messages like governments controlling the weather, vaccines causing autism, or outright climate change denial are gaining more followers who vote based on these beliefs.\n\nNo one willingly wants to stop living as they currently do, but in one way or another, people\u2019s living conditions will be significantly altered. Either we change our habits toward a lower-carbon lifestyle, or the effects of climate change will make it impossible to continue living as we do. For these reasons, I think it is unlikely we will ever elect someone who speaks candidly about what is necessary to mitigate and adapt to climate change, simply because it would be unpopular.\n\nIn summary, I believe Fiorino\u2019s arguments in favor of democratic regimes are, in some cases, double-edged swords and, in others, characteristics not inherently unique to democracies. I do not believe a world governed by dictatorships would be better for addressing climate change\u2014in that, I agree with Fiorino\u2014but I also think climate-related decisions should not be entirely subject to the control of democratic institutions, which are increasingly weak, unstable, and vulnerable to climate change denialists.\n\nIs it possible to create a kind of autonomous climate council capable of making binding regulatory decisions without oversight from other government bodies? Or a sort of environmental/climate oversight body required to approve government climate policies before their implementation? Can any regulatory body truly operate without the influence of democratic institutions? For now, I think the answer to these questions is no. I also do not believe there is a single solution or an easy answer to this problem, but I am certain that continuing on the current path is not an option for civilization.\n\nI welcome comments from others who are as concerned about this issue as I am.\n\n(Note: This text was translated using AI.

This isn't even unique to democracy.  Communism was productivist aka growthist too.  It'd never have gone so far if it was not. \n\nWe know small tribes that maintains multiple aspects of their ecosystem well.  We know island dictatorships like shogunate Japan and the Dominican Republic who reforested or agressively protected forests, both with real sacrifice.

Removing your consent from them is the thing they hate most - protests they can spin to make their supporters feel more confident, but lack of confidence in them is their Achilles heal.\n\nWhy would it be wrong to reduce your consumption, and to stop funding corporations? You don\u2019t seriously think that one memo from 40+ years ago is the only plan they have to fool the public?\n\nWhen you\u2019re telling people they should be buying from the corporations that are destroying the planet in order to stick it to them, then you should question whether you\u2019re passing on misinformation.\n\nYes, go out and do stuff in nature. But also, stop buying from those companies. No matter what people tell you about a memo from 40 years ago that got leaked and is now used as proof that you totally shouldn\u2019t stop consuming more if you\u2019re proud of your contrariness.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a looking-glass world if you trust memes rather than your own common sense.\n\nNot to mention, your approach has been followed for 20+ years with the problem getting worse every year. It\u2019s just wrong, we need to stop sharing that meme and start boycotting companies. If we actually care, and aren\u2019t just showing off.",

He's on the record as a climate change denier, but protest voting? That's genius.\n\nSo, any country, which party is your version of the UK Green party? Which party cares about the environment and climate change. America has two years before your next election and in the UK we have council and parish elections. So vote green, or whichever party is your version of it.\n\nFor the last decade, immigration has dominated the news cycles because people assume voters are voting on it as a topic and some are. But it's dominated politics for a decade even though not nearly as many people are against it as they think there are.\n\nThe only way we can move the needle on the political level, is by using our votes to protest. If we can get as many people as possible to vote Green, it affects their vote share, frightens them and turns political debate towards the environment.\n\nBut how do we go about this? Thoughts? Suggestions?  \n",

        "Content": "(something like this:)\n\n(This is intended to be the next big follow-on to the IRA/Inflation Reduction Act, and also to either replace or be an adjunct to the Clean Air Act, in the U.S., and can be adopted similarly anywhere:)\n\n3 Targets:\n\nYour Stove\n\nYour Car\n\nYour House\n\nStoves- are to be replaced with electric.\n\nCars- are to be replaced with electric.\n\nHouse- solar panels go on the roof, and/or, green energy of some form, nuclear acceptable, is to replace the local power plant.\n\nMandates- all designers and producers of gas-using equipment are mandated to begin a sequential phase-out as follows:\n\n\\-All equipment currently in design but yet not in production: these designs are to be cancelled. Now you will design electric equipment.\n\n\\-All equipment currently in production: you may finish this production run, for now; you must discontinue production no later than one year from now. Ramp-ups during this year, in an attempt to meet investments costs, will be tolerated.\n\nIncentives: incentives will be offered as follows- to help electric-equipment manufacturers ramp-up production of electric equipment, and, to enable lower-income buyers to better afford novel electric equipment. these incentives are to be determined within reasonability of budget considerations.\n\nThe People are asked additionally to adopt these guidelines for themselves to every extent possible, to conserve resources of gas-using equipment in the meantime by lowering as much as possible whatever they consider to be non-essential use until full system change has been implemented.\n\nForward-looking statements:\n\nThe next big consideration will be limiting the power available to: data centers in general, and, to AI data centers.\n\nLet us decide first on something: what is a reasonable amount of online storage for each person, on average? How many gigabytes of free online storage should each person get, as offered by free-online-storage companies?\n\nThen: which AI operations yet running are truly of service to us and have passed muster already? Let us chop back lesser attempts and reasonably regulate start-ups. Start-ups with clearly novel uses for AI proposed will be favored.\n\nIn general, these two ideas will be applied toward regulating the power-use problems associated with online data centers and AI-specific online data centers.\n\nA starting analogy for data-use determination: if everyone used paper, and you were going to give everyone a free warehouse to store their paperwork in, how big would you make the warehouse? As big as their house? Ten times as big as their house? A hundred times as big as their house? A thousand times as big as their house? Half as big as their house? A quarter as big as their house? To just stuff to the top with paperwork.\n\nDoes everyone need to store a thousand times their house's worth of just stuffed, junk paperwork, that they're now storing only because you gave them a big free warehouse to do it in?\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever bothered going through all your online files to determine which should be thrown out and which should be kept, now that you've been given however many gigabytes online to just store old junk files in?\n\nI don't think there is a \"need\", to give everyone many many many gigabytes of free, or paid-for, online storage, just because companies like doing this and people are happy to accept.\n\nFor that matter, I'm not sure everyone needs the entirety of their computer files copied over to Microsoft or Google both, or whoever else, in addition to all old emails plus entire contents of older computers and reams of old photos or whatever goes into people's junk collections. Just because it's online doesn't mean it's under the rug! Somewhere a data center is wasting power for that stuff while our environment burns and green energy has not been fully installed. We should relieve the demands on energy while installing green energy, this will make that transition less complicated and more functional off the bat. Let people decide whatever of these products they like most and get the most use out of it, and otherwise, let's chop it back. A reasonable amount of storage, a reasonable degree of hard drive copying.\n\nFurther-\n\nrations of beef consumption due to methane concerns- people should take it upon themselves to at least cut back on their beef consumption. bison is a clever substitute as is available by the way, as bison do not have four-chambered stomachs and don't produce the same amount of methane (i think? i need to double check this). beef can also be made more expensive to help this and mandates can be placed on the beef industry to start limiting their operations to certain levels.\n\nrations of airline use since many people consider airline use essential to their jobs and so far there's only gas-powered airplanes. However, electric air vehicles can and should be designed; smaller ones work already. Also, self-driving cars that can drive a person through the night while they sleep might be an interesting future alternative to otherwise making a morning airplane trip.\n\nOther-\n\nthere's some other problem with I think gas from certain designs of refrigerator? or air conditioning? i forget which one this is i think its a refrigerator type. these should be phased out.\n\nThat (all the above) basically solves the whole problem.\n\n2 other considerations- military and getting everyone else to do the same\n\nmilitary- we have many nuclear-powered assets already. we can transition to relying on these types of vehicles for deterrence. all gas-powered assets can serve a limited continuation period, relative to the civilian stance, while military vehicle designers ultimately have the same mandate: start designing things that can rely on electric power, nuclear is fine, and/or, keep gas/dirty-propellant fired things to some minimum and increasingly reduce them in future designs.\n\ngetting other people (around the globe) to do the same thing- ultimately the world looks to the U.S. for leadership. U.S. does it, in time, everyone does it. if we define the state of modernity as being x y and z, then, this is what the modern state is, and everyone will want the same thing or feel outdated. if the electric car is the modern car then everyone will feel that theyre living in the past to drive a gas car.\n\nAn example for electric cars- In China, electric cars have caught on because they're more popular, not because anyone forced them to do it. This predicts that in general, anyone who tries an electric car will find it to be the futuristic, modern car, compared to the gas-powered car, and they will no longer want a gas-powered car. Just gotta get them to try it first. As more gas cars become unavailable and more electric cars become available, one day they aren't going to have much to try at a dealership beside electric car models and they'll try it, and they'll realize they like it better and were just being stubborn about trying a new thing. electric car prices should be coming down as more of them become used first and U.S. automakers at some point put out good cheap new electrics second.\n\nthis is a draft idea; who cares if it won't be popular yet or isn't officially designated; let's work on it, let's have a draft. feel free to discuss changes or additions you think should be made in the comments. a one-act-fixes-all-environment-problems act.\n\nAddition- considerations for:\n\n\\-a phase-out otherwise of all nuclear power by 50 years after this act, to eliminate any future problem of toxic waste or safety concerns of over-reliance on nuclear energy, such that solar and wind will be favored and more-perfected and more-sufficiently-widespread by this date. possible exceptions or modifiers: -that waste be cleverly re-used as lower-tech heating equipment -that exceptions be made perhaps for extreme-condition scientific research labs on earth for nuclear power, such as in antarctica or underwater -that fusion energy, if perfected, safe, and not-significantly-waste-forming, be allowed\n\n\\-a phase-out otherwise of all remaining military power-source and warhead assets by 100 years after this act, at which point exceptions or transitions will be made such as: that no earth-based nuclear warhead system be aimed at earth-based targets or intended for use against earth-based targets, and that instead any such system be employed only for anti-asteroid defenses, and by a sort of united earth force -that nuclear power systems otherwise be allowed only for cases of space exploration, transport, research laboratory, and/or colonization purposes.",

The IRA was the most significant climate legislation the US has passed, but it was only a fraction of what it could have been if there had just been two more climate friendly Democrats in the Senate.  If you're in a swing state, I encourage you to consider joining your local Democratic party and donating to them.  I want to put up the disclaimer that I'm not a fan of either party, but Democrats are the lesser evil especially when it comes to climate.  I know we just got out of a crushing presidential election, but at this point it's not too early to think about the 26 midterms and the 28 general.  If you can find specific candidates running on a climate friendly platform I encourage you to donate to them.  Also, don't ignore local politics!  Your city council and state reps are super important in making climate action happen. Donating to a mayoral candidate who wants to build out mass transit, bike infrastructure, and build dense efficient housing can have a tremendous impact.\n\nBesides politics, I'd also look into supporting local environmental organizations.  Local nonprofits do a lot of the work that government should be doing but fails to do.  Go ask on your local subreddit what environmental orgs you should support.",

It prevents air from getting out and prevents water (which can freeze in the tire) and debris from getting in and causing leaks, which further reduce your MPG and your tires need replacing sooner. That shit's expensive and uses a lot of rubber.

I really try not to be /that/ person because I know not everyone can afford to make the greener changes like ebike-ing to work or driving a greener car or driving less to work but diet is 100% a thing that is within our control. It's an effort to adjust but it's cheaper (and has been verified in the literature for those who want to argue otherwise) When I say this I'm not even trying to appeal to animal welfare. I just mean environmentally speaking, an animal-heavy diet is worse for the environment than a plant based or a very minimally-animal based diet. There's no if's ands or buts about it. Any remediatory red herrings like regenerative grazing etc are a band-aid at best and still predicate themselves on what is ultimately a consumer choice for flavor and not wanting to confront our own values to see if they align with our actions.\n\nIt embitters me because I know we're not perfect but a lot of climate activists are far from challenging ourselves.

One of the benefits of certain natural products is that they have a longer lifespan than synthetics; a well maintained pair of leather shoes can last well over a lifetime, often.  The same can't be said of synthetics.\n\nWith certain environmental issues there's going to be some conflicts--emissions vs. plastics, for example.  Certain treatments for natural products can be damaging, but there are sometimes ways of curing and so on that are less damaging.  And like I said in my first post, I think it's hard for me to overlook some of the incredibly detrimental effects of plastics and microplastics to the environment, human health, and ethics (I can't imagine what some of the factories that produce synthetic clothing must like for the workers and the local environment; this isn't to discount the ethical issues of animal products, but just to say it's another situation where we're in a bit of a bind).  That most synthetics are also imported (and later exported when we don't want them) also makes me question how environmentally sound they can be. While the same can be said of certain animal products, sometimes I guess we have to juggle between the lesser of evils? But like I said, I will try to do more research into this and will try to do so later (I'm on break too).\n\nRandom edit: I will also occasionally consume honey, as an example of another animal product that I think is generally ethically acceptable to many and generally environmentally neutral at least.",

        "Content": "Refined Thermosyphon System: Design and Operational Summary\n\nThe thermosyphon system is a cutting-edge, scalable solution designed to extract excess heat from ocean water, generate freshwater, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Through innovative integration of renewable energy, sustainable materials, and advanced technologies, the system provides a multifaceted approach to address critical global challenges, including water scarcity, ocean warming, and environmental protection.\nCore Components and Functions\n\n    Central Thermosyphon Cylinder\n\n        Heat Extraction:\n        The vertical thermosyphon leverages the temperature gradient between warm surface water and cooler deep water. A working fluid (CO\u2082 or ammonia) absorbs heat from the ocean surface, causing the fluid to evaporate and rise through the system.\n\n        Heat Rejection:\n        The heated refrigerant flows to a heat rejection chamber, where it condenses within an insulated pool, transferring the extracted heat to the desalination process. The cooled fluid returns to repeat the cycle.\n\n    Insulated Pool with Integrated Desalination\n\n        Evaporation:\n        The insulated pool captures the rejected heat, creating a warm environment that maximizes evaporation. The system is insulated to reduce energy loss.\n\n        Condensation:\n        A transparent cover traps evaporated water vapor, which is directed toward inclined condensation panels. These panels cool the vapor, causing it to condense into fresh water.\n\n        Freshwater Collection:\n        Condensed freshwater is funneled into gravity-driven drip channels leading to storage tanks. A separate outlet for brine ensures salinity is managed effectively.\n\n    Concentric Structural Design for Stability and Efficiency\n\n        Stability and Efficiency:\n        The central thermosyphon is supported by radial horizontal arms, ensuring stability. Solar panels and flotation devices are arranged concentrically to optimize space for both energy collection and heat rejection.\n\n        Energy Optimization:\n        Solar panels provide auxiliary power, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing reliance on external energy sources. They also serve as partial shading for the desalination pool, reducing evaporation losses.\n\n    Modular, Scalable, and Autonomous Operation\n\n        Modular Pods:\n        The system is designed with modular components, allowing for easy scalability to meet the needs of different regions. Pods can be connected or disconnected as required, offering flexibility for varying community sizes and environmental conditions.\n\n        Autonomous Maintenance:\n        Autonomous robots or drones can be deployed for cleaning, inspection, and maintenance, reducing human intervention and extending the system's lifespan.\n\n    Advanced Environmental Protection\n\n        Double-Wall Heat Exchanger:\n        The heat exchanger is designed with a double-wall construction, allowing any refrigerant leaks to safely vent to the atmosphere, preventing contamination of the water and the formation of carbonic acid.\n\n        Eco-Friendly Coatings:\n        Non-toxic, anti-fouling coatings are applied to all exposed surfaces to prevent biofouling and corrosion. These coatings are made from sustainable, bio-based materials that minimize environmental impact.\n\n        Brine Management:\n        Brine discharge is managed using advanced filtration or concentration techniques, reducing the environmental impact. In some cases, brine can be converted into valuable byproducts like salt or magnesium for industrial uses.\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Carbon Capture\n\n    Energy Storage and Hybrid Power Systems\n\n        Battery Storage:\n        Solar power is stored in batteries, ensuring continuous system operation during low sunlight or at night. This energy storage reduces the system's reliance on external power sources.\n\n        Hybrid Power:\n        Integration with wave energy converters or tidal turbines offers a consistent power supply, particularly in remote coastal areas, further increasing system efficiency.\n\n    Carbon Capture and Sequestration\n        Carbon Capture Units:\n        The system can be equipped with carbon capture technologies that extract CO\u2082 from the atmosphere or seawater, sequestering it in deep oceanic storage or in mineralized forms, contributing to climate change mitigation.\n\n    Phase Change Materials (PCMs):\n        Thermal Energy Storage:\n        The incorporation of PCMs within the system can store excess heat for later use, balancing fluctuations in energy demand and improving overall thermal efficiency.\n\nSymbiosis with Marine Ecosystems\n\n    Artificial Reefs and Aquaculture Platforms\n\n        Marine Habitat Creation:\n        The flotation devices and structural components can function as artificial reefs, providing habitat for marine organisms. This promotes biodiversity and supports marine ecosystems.\n\n        Aquaculture Integration:\n        The system can be integrated with sustainable aquaculture practices, such as fish farming or seaweed cultivation, providing additional food sources while also helping maintain water quality.\n\n    Seaweed Farming for Carbon Sequestration\n        Seaweed farms could be cultivated alongside the thermosyphon units, contributing to carbon sequestration while also supporting marine biodiversity and providing sustainable bio-products.\n\n    Eco-Friendly Designs for Marine Life\n        The system employs acoustic dampeners and low-profile designs to reduce noise pollution and physical disturbance to marine species, ensuring the system operates harmoniously within its environment.\n\nOutreach and Community Engagement\n\n    Public Awareness and Education\n        An interactive dashboard can track system performance and environmental impact, offering transparency and educational opportunities for local communities, NGOs, and the general public.\n\n    Eco-Tourism Integration\n        The system can incorporate eco-tourism elements, such as observation platforms or guided tours, generating additional revenue to support ongoing operations and increasing awareness of sustainable ocean technologies.\n\n    Collaborations with Governments and NGOs\n        Partnerships with environmental organizations, local governments, and academic institutions can help further research, provide funding, and support system adoption in coastal regions.\n\nConclusion: A Scalable and Sustainable Solution\n\nThe refined thermosyphon system offers a self-sustaining, environmentally friendly solution for addressing global challenges such as water scarcity, ocean warming, and climate change. By integrating renewable energy, eco-friendly materials, modular design, and innovative cooling technologies, the system can be scaled to meet the specific needs of various regions while fostering symbiotic relationships with marine ecosystems. It represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable freshwater production, climate adaptation, and ocean conservation, with the potential for broad adoption by coastal communities, governments, and environmental organizations.\n",

        "Content": "Hi everyone, new poster here so forgive me if this has already been discussed (I read the rules!) There is a question/CTA here at the end, but bear with me as I explain my thinking first:\n\nI have been thinking a lot on climate action and how to keep it moving within the reality of the US as it stands today, with the current incoming government. Acknowledging that the political parties of today have evolved quite a bit since the turn of the century, there is a decent amount of conservation history within the Republican Party (Theodore Roosevelt started the National Parks, Nixon created the EPA, etc) and since enjoying nature and caring about our future are qualities endemic to all humans, I have a feeling that given the \\*right messaging\\*, there could be ways to create a series of targeted, real policies that could find bipartisan support, even with the incoming administration. They might be baby steps, but some progress is better than nothing, right?\n\nI have been searching within Reddit for posts in conservative spaces asking how conservatives feel about environmentalism. Surprisingly (or not), many have said they are not against it at all, but rather various feelings about big government and overreach, and various feelings about the EPA's approach to CO2. Emissions regulations seems to be a sticking point, but maybe this is where we need to get clever with how we package these solutions and really come in ready to compromise. There have got to be specific things in every state that need protecting or cleaning up, that could fit within the acceptable framework of the current GOP. Preserving forests, tree planting initiatives, nuclear energy, carbon fees are all conservative solutions proposed by conservative conservation organizations (yes they exist! I was surprised to find!)\n\nI keep imagining a network of activists, organized by region, welcome to anyone within the political spectrum, and write policy tailored to the current waters we swim in. Each quarter, a singular goal for each region is chosen and pursued with focused intensity. Letter writing, speaking on socials, telling everyone a simple way they can help by spreading awareness, calling and trying to meet with politicians, with the benefit of a new and unknown entity that isn't already tied to one political side. We avoid talking negatively about specific lawmakers, but praise those who take action to the heavens and back, even if you disagree vehemently with their other policies. That might mean rewriting things and considering tactics that would seem undesirable, but the overarching goal would be something is better than nothing. For example, maybe there's a piece of land out there that desperately needs federal protection, and we convince the incoming president that it would be pretty cool to have a new national park in their name. Or perhaps there's a favorite forest of a very conservative Senator who would like the idea of advocating for wildlife crossing corridors to protect the animals who live there. SOMETHING, anything. Challenge ourselves to find pieces of environmentally friendly policy that even the most pro-business politicians could get behind, establishing ourselves as truly willing to work with anyone. Gaining trust and celebrating every win even if it's moving an inch in the right direction.\n\nHowever, given the heated and strong feelings everyone has politically, I am not sure if it's a pipe dream to try and start this type of work. I don't know if it's possible for people to compromise in this way, if the appetite to work to make things appealing within someone you disagree with's political views are something people would be willing to do. To accomplish goals within the opposing team's playbook.\n\nSo I am curious to hear what you think, if anyone has tried similar things before, for better or worse. I just feel like even if a handful of things are accomplished, even small, would be better than nothing at all. \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!",

                "Content": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with starting something like this on a smaller, community sized level. Any kind of environmental change or cause is always going to be met with pushback, regardless if they\u2019re conservative or not. But we wouldn\u2019t be here today with new solutions if someone didn\u2019t start somewhere, and a lot of things weren\u2019t as politically motivated as some thought. 10 years ago, solar energy and solars panels taking off seemed like a pipe dream. Today it\u2019s leading in clean energy and is seen as less expensive than gas. 10 years ago, climate skepticism was leading over actual science. Today most of the US agrees we are facing a climate crisis. But again, it all started somewhere. More likely, it started small scaled. \n\nPersonally, I like your idea. Climate change shouldn\u2019t be political, but like most things in life, it is. I\u2019d encourage you, if anything, find people in your town/county and go from there. Offer small scale solutions someone can do in their backyard (a great place to start is planting native flowers in your area). \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this answers your question, but you\u2019d be surprised with how many people are pro climate. You have a lot of influence, don\u2019t get trapped in the \u201cbut conservatives think this way\u201d cycle. I\u2019ve been able to explain my reasonings as to why I care for the climate to conservatives in rural Alabama by trying to point out things a bad climate would impact in their life. Small businesses, farming, and livestock seem to do the trick. I wish you luck, starting something large scale is no easy feat, but you\u2019ve got this",

Now think for a bit... if they're lying to you about coral and mollusks (remember that the Great Barrier Reef now has a higher extent than in all of its observed history, while they were telling you it was dying and *It's All Your Fault*), what else are they lying to you about?\n\nI can answer that, too: [https://www.patriotaction.us/showthread.php?tid=2711](https://www.patriotaction.us/showthread.php?tid=2711)\n\nThis is a repost from /u/[ClimateSkeptics](https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/1gsv82i/corals_and_mollusks_were_being_lied_to/).\n\n===============\n\n\"*We must protect the corals! CO2 is going to kill all the coral! It's an existential crisis!*\", we're told.\n\nFor instance:  \n[https://www.surfrider.org/news/washington-state-re-ups-leadership-in-addressing-ocean-acidification](https://www.surfrider.org/news/washington-state-re-ups-leadership-in-addressing-ocean-acidification)  \n\"*Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the past two centuries have altered the chemistry of the world\u2019s oceans, threatening the health of coastal ecosystems and industries that depend on the marine environment.*\"\n\n\"*Calcifiers are marine organisms that depend on the mineral calcium carbonate to make shells, skeletons, and other hard body parts. Ocean acidification makes an essential component of calcium carbonate \u2013 the*\u00a0***carbonate ion***\u00a0*\u2013 more scarce. As a result, calcifiers have to use more energy to pull*\u00a0***carbonate ions***\u00a0*out of the water to build their shells. Calcium carbonate also dissolves more easily as acidity increases. These changes can result in slower growth and/or higher mortality among calcifiers, especially in shellfish larvae and juvenile shellfish.*\"\n\nCorals and mollusks, which evolved during the Cambrian Explosion which had many times higher CO2 concentration (which was arguably the cause\u00a0**of**\u00a0the Cambrian Explosion),\u00a0**evolved no carbonate transporters**, instead evolving\u00a0**bicarbonate transporters**... because as CO2 concentration rises, ocean pH falls which means carbonate practically disappears at \\~pH6; whereas as CO2 concentration rises, ocean bicarbonate concentration rises, thus that makes it\u00a0**easier**\u00a0for coral and mollusks to undergo the calcification process. Calcification is currently rate-limited because atmospheric CO2 concentration is nearly at historic lows, and thus oceanic bicarbonate concentration is comparatively low.\n\nIOW,\u00a0**if you want to 'save the corals', emit more CO2**.\n\nBut all of the \"*muh CO2 bad*\" blather about CO2 harming corals is predicated upon the corals using\u00a0**carbonate**\u00a0transporters. To date, several\u00a0**bicarbonate**\u00a0transporters have been found across a wide taxa of corals and mollusks, whereas\u00a0**no carbonate transporters have been found**.\n\n**\\[1\\]**\u00a0CO2 (carbon dioxide) + H2O (water) ==> H2CO3 (carbonic acid)\n\n**\\[2\\]**\u00a0Aqueous: H2CO3 (carbonic acid, from\u00a0**\\[1\\]**) ==> H^(+)\u00a0(hydrogen cation) + HCO3^(-)\u00a0(bicarbonate anion)\n\n**\\[3\\]**\u00a0In-vivo: Bicarbonate transporter transports HCO3^(-)\u00a0(bicarbonate anion, from\u00a0**\\[2\\]**) across cellular membrane\n\n**\\[4\\]**\u00a0In-vivo: HCO3^(-)\u00a0(bicarbonate anion, from\u00a0**\\[3\\]**) ==> CO3^(-2)\u00a0(carbonate anion) + H^(+)\u00a0(hydrogen cation)\n\n**\\[5\\]**\u00a0In-vivo: CO3^(-2)\u00a0(carbonate anion, from\u00a0**\\[4\\]**) + Ca^(+2)\u00a0(calcium cation, dissolved in water) ==> CaCO3 (calcium carbonate)\n\n**\\[6\\]**\u00a0In-vivo then excreted: H^(+)\u00a0(hydrogen cation, from\u00a0**\\[4\\]**) + H2O (water) ==> H3O^(+)\u00a0(hydronium cation)\n\nYes,\u00a0**coral and mollusks excrete acid**.\n\npH = \u2212log\\_10 \\[H^(+)\\]\n\nAnd that excreted H3O^(+)\u00a0(hydronium cation, from\u00a0**\\[6\\]**) then goes on to interact:\n\n**\\[7\\]**\u00a0Aqueous: H3O^(+)\u00a0(hydronium cation, from\u00a0**\\[6\\]**) + CO3^(-2)\u00a0(carbonate anion, dissolved in water) ==> H2CO3 (carbonic acid) + OH^(-)\u00a0(hydroxide anion)\n\n**\\[8\\]**\u00a0Aqueous: H2CO3 (carbonic acid, from\u00a0**\\[7\\]**) ==> H^(+)\u00a0(hydrogen cation) + HCO3^(-)\u00a0(bicarbonate anion)\n\n**\\[9\\]**\u00a0Aqueous: OH^(-)\u00a0(hydroxide anion, from\u00a0**\\[7\\]**) + H^(+)\u00a0(hydrogen cation, from\u00a0**\\[2\\]**\u00a0or\u00a0**\\[8\\]**) ==> H2O (water)\n\nYou'll note that the hydronium (H3O^(+)) cations actively scavenge carbonate anions (CO3^(-2)) (which the coral and mollusks cannot use) and coverts them into carbonic acid (H2CO3), which then undergoes the first aqueous reaction above to convert to H^(+)\u00a0(hydrogen cation) and HCO3^(-)\u00a0(bicarbonate anion... which the coral and mollusks can use).\n\nKind of strange that coral and mollusks can handle the extreme acid of undiluted H^(+), and H3O^(+)\u00a0(the strongest acid that can exist in water), but purportedly they can't handle a tiny change in ocean pH, despite evolving at a time when atmospheric CO2 concentration was many times higher than today and thus the ocean was less alkaline.",

                "Content": "It turns out I got things turned around. The actual information is the lower calcium bicarbonate there is the lower the PH which is the cause of acidification. I was also wrong about carbonates, they don't increase as CO2 increases, they decrease which causes the lowering of PH. Apologizes for that one but in the end it still stands. Too much CO2 entering our oceans in a rapid succession which gets absorbed by our ocean lowers PH and thus causes acidification. Also Corals and mollusks don't stay stagnant, they change alongside the oceans. So them evolving around CO2 concentration peaking may be correct, but they are not the same species as today. Edit: Also all the carbon will eventually lay to the bottom of the ocean but it will take time and the rapid releasing of CO2 which being absorbed by the ocean is too much.",

Also the first corals their family already went extinct during the Permian extinction event, which funnily enough had a high CO2 levels causing Acidification. The modern corals we have today are not the same as the ones that first existed.\n\nNaturally, the corals and oysters that do emit a small increase in CO2 concentration emit a \"SMALL\" concentration compared to the mass amounts of CO2 which dissolves Calcium bicarbonates due to Carbonic acids. CO2 dissolving in water creates hydrogen which lowers PH which also decreases calcium bicarbonates.\n\nSorry man, but to save corals and mollusks we have to restore natural carbon captures like seagrass, old growth forests, rainforests, kelp forests, restoring wildlife conservation, and of course moving away from CO2 releasing energy sources.\n\nI don't know what non scientific rock you have been under, too much CO2 being released at a rapid time is bad as an infamous extinction event has had massive amounts of CO2 being one of the many causes of said extinction event. Corals and oyster reefs are affected due to lower PH causing Acidification which degrades protective layers and obliterates young corals.\n\nAlso the whole \"Its All your Fault\" thing is weird.

                "Content": "You're conflating terms... what you call \"acidification\" is actually a tiny decrease in the average alkalinity of the ocean. The ocean averages \\~8.1 pH.\n\nAnd again, shellfish see many times higher change on a per-day basis than the change in the average, it changes \\~0.2 to 0.4 pH day to night to day.\n\nThey absolutely are the same species today as they were back then, many taxa in the fossil record are still alive today, and they still use the same bicarbonate transporters that they originally evolved. And the ones today are the fittest, those most able to efficiently convert bicarbonate into calcium carbonate... so a relatively small increase in CO2 concentration will cause a relatively small increase in oceanic bicarbonate concentration, but those fitter organisms will gobble it up, they'll vastly increase their calcification rate.\n\nThat's why the Great Barrier Reef is at its highest extent in observed history. The more CO2 we emit, the more CO2 goes into the ocean, the more bicarbonate is generated in water from carbonic acid, the more the calcifiers can calcify.\n\nSo if you want to \"save the corals and mollusks\", emit\u00a0**more**\u00a0CO2.\n\nYou've been lied to.

Sure you do. Then give it the molecule of life: CO2.

It's good for them. We're at nearly historic low CO2 levels now, they're struggling. Do your part to help out the corals and mollusks, emit more CO2.\n\nIn fact, were it not for that calcification, most of the state of Florida wouldn't exist.

Through RA, I have focused on giving small businesses the access to participate in the sustainability agenda by modelling a very low cost strategic advisory and data automation service.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know!\n\nFor anyone who is new and wants to learn a bit about the context of sustainability, I have written an article for my friends magazine, which is attached.\n",

Despite my best efforts, that does not seem to have been the case. Forest fires in Massachusetts and elsewhere in winter was not on my list of likely outcomes. (link at bottom)\n\nLooking at the bigger categories, I commuted by public transportation for a decade, I cut my plane flights by 90%, I chose to not have biological children, I lived in a tiny house, I created lower carbon solutions for clients in my professional work for clients who generally didnt care about carbon impact.\n\nBut I now see how little that has changed and I known those clients in my industry are discontinuing low carb efforts and returning to typical practices. And as one better examines and quantifies impact it is clear that individual choices (up or down) pale in comparison to those with greater reach and power; the decisions of the 1920s onward propelled technologies, construction, and consumption patterns far greater in magnitude and more destructive in scope than individuals or families.\n\nWhat do people do for the later part of their careers and pursuits in the face of how ineffective the previous decades of attempted climate change mitigation have proven to be? Or is it just fiddling while rome burns?\n\n  \n[https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/regional/2024/11/19/massachusetts-wildfire-map-smoke-blue-hills-reservation/76423282007/](https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/regional/2024/11/19/massachusetts-wildfire-map-smoke-blue-hills-reservation/76423282007/)",

It's time to change that.\n\n[OpenClimate.fund](http://OpenClimate.fund) aims to bridge this gap by funding an ecosystem built on transparency, trust, and collaboration to advance climate-friendly technologies and measurable environmental impact.\n\n[https://opensustain.tech/blog/openclimatefund/](https://opensustain.tech/blog/openclimatefund/)",

        "Content": "The global climate action should be changed from mitigation & adaption to mitigation & restoration. In this context \"restoration\" means climate restoration. Climate restoration is the act of restoring Earths climate to its pre-industrial state by removing CO2 from the atmosphere after net zero CO2 emissions has been reached. All anthropological CO2 which is currently in the atmosphere will need to be removed in order to restore Earths climate. \n\nFor this plan to work all human activates will need to be made carbon neutral. In this climate action plan carbon removal is only used to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere not offset off emissions. There is no such thing as \"hard to abate\" sectors. Drop-in biofuels produced from residual biomass can replace fuel for aviation and shipping. Solar or nuclear thermochemical hydrogen and biochar can replace steelmaking coal. Concrete can be made using non-cement binders like granite or basalt. High temperature Industrial heat can be produced using solar thermal or nuclear energy. All human activities need to be made carbon neutral in order to enable the usage of carbon removal for reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. \n\nInstead of adapting to the effects of climate change which are happening right now, we should artificially maintain pre-industrial climatic conditions using Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). OTEC will reduce the temperature of the ocean surface in addition to generating carbon neutral electricity. Reducing the temperature of the ocean surface will reduce the intensity of heatwaves, hurricanes and floods. \n\n \n\n[The water discharged from the heat exchanger and condenser is what will cool the surrounding ocean.](https://preview.redd.it/y48daak5doyd1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=83953f4d042fd3e2b93dc7f4451188e69bf1039c)\n\nHere are the most ideal carbon removal methods which can be used to restore Earths climate\n\n1. Biochar \n\n2. Regenerative agriculture \n\n3. Enhanced rock weathering \n\n4. Turning biomass into fossil fuels and putting these fossil fuels back underground \n\n5. Sinking harmful algae blooms \n\n6. Growing and sinking seaweed \n\n7. Carbon removing seawater electrolysis  \n\n8. Wastewater CO2 mineralization \n\n9. Cement free concrete \n\n10. Producing carbon nanotubes from biogenic CO2 \n\nAll of these carbon removal methods are either not energy intensive or produce energy which can be used to power themselves. \n\nClimate change is often said to be \"irreversible\" because returning to the pre-industrial global average temperature will not undo certain changes like sea level rise or ecosystem loss. This is false. These sorts of changes will need separate actions to undo. Sea level can be restored by refreezing the arctic using solar geoengineering. Ecosystems can be restored using conventional ecosystems restoration methods. Each one of these \"irreversible\" changes will need their own specific actions in order to undo.  \n\nI believe that if we truly care about human civilization and the natural environment we should pursue climate restoration instead of climate adaption in addition to climate mitigation.

A key part of the solution is recognizing that large corporations are satisfied that the responsibility for solving the environmental crisis falls on individuals, when the real solution depends largely on a few, not a mere mortal like you or me.\"\n\n  \nEnglish Response\n\n1) Plastic recycling is the only type of recycling that is generally ineffective, and only because manufacturers are not required to recycle even if it is unprofitable. Glass recycling is usually profitable, so glass is usually recycled, but there have been times when the market collapsed and crushed glass was put in landfills. Metal and paper recycling is profitable, so metal and glass are always recycled.\n\n2) Corporations do want us to think that all environmental solutions fall on individuals, but the only thing they respond to besides government regulation is what you choose to purchase. They want you to buy plastic because it is cheap for them, but they sell plastic because we buy it. Try to purchase things with reduced packaging and you will find more manufacturers reduce their packaging. I've been buying shampoo bars instead of shampoo bottles for years. When I started there were 2 options, now there are dozens. \n\nGoogle Translate\n\n1) \n\n    El reciclaje de pl\u00e1stico es el \u00fanico tipo de reciclaje que generalmente es ineficaz, y s\u00f3lo porque los fabricantes no est\u00e1n obligados a reciclar incluso si no es rentable.

        "Content": "The practice of scuttling decommissioned ships is often seen as a way to create habitat for marine life. However, few people are willing to admit the fact that this practice is counterproductive to both climate and biodiversity action. The longer we are unaware of this fact the more severe the climate and biodiversity impacts of reefing decommissioned ships will become.\n\nHere are the reasons why\n\n1. Scuttling decommissioned ships to create artifical reefs is counterproductive to climate action because it creates the need to produce new steel from iron ore using anthracite coal in blast furnaces. The steel that makes up decommissioned ships is removed from the recycling circulation when these ships are turned into artifical reefs. New steel will need to be made from iron ore to make up for the steel lost by reefing decommissioned ships. Iron ore is reduced into steel with the carbon that makes up anthracite coal. Carbon neutral steelmaking technologies are decades away from replacing anthracite coal fed blast furnaces as the predominant steelmaking technology. As of now we need to maximize the amount of steel which is either recycled or repurposed to reduce the steel industries climate impact, reefing decommissioned ships will not allow this to happen\n2. Scuttling decommissioned ships to create artificial reefs is counterproductive to biodiversity action because such artifical reefs increase the spread of invasive species. Dive wrecks provide habitat for invasive marine species. The population and range of invasive marine species will increase because dive wreck can act as habitat for them. Artificial reefs made by scuttling decommissioned reefs are worsening the infestations of invasive marine species which are already causing serious problems for both human civilization and the natural environment. \n\n  \nThe practice of scuttling decommissioned ships to create artifical reefs is a contributor to climate change just like fossil fuel energy production or industrial agriculture. The sooner we discontinue this practice the sooner the climate impact of this practice will be eliminated. Scuttling decommissioned ships to create artificial reefs should be opposed like any other human activity which contributes to climate change. ",
