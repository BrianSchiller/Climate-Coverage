                "Content": "Zo\u00eb Schlanger: \u201cAs Hurricane Milton exploded from a Category 1 storm into a Category 5 storm over the course of 12 hours yesterday, climate scientists and meteorologists were stunned. NBC6\u2019s John Morales, a veteran TV meteorologist in South Florida, choked up on air while describing how quickly and dramatically the storm had intensified. To most people, a drop in pressure of 50 millibars means nothing; a weatherman understands, as Morales said mid-broadcast, that \u2018this is just horrific.\u2019 Florida is still cleaning up from Helene; this storm is spinning much faster, and it\u2019s more compact and organized.\n\n\u201cIn a way, Milton is exactly the type of storm that scientists have been warning could happen; Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, called it shocking but not surprising. \u2018One of the things we know is that, in a warmer world, the most intense storms are more intense,\u2019 he told me. Milton might have been a significant hurricane regardless, but every aspect of the storm that could have been dialed up has been.\n\n\u201cA hurricane forms from multiple variables, and in Milton, the variables have come together to form a nightmare. The storm is gaining considerable energy thanks to high sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which is far hotter than usual. And that energy translates into higher wind speeds. Milton is also taking up moisture from the very humid atmosphere, which, as a rule, can hold 7 percent more water vapor for every degree-Celsius increase in temperature. Plus, the air is highly unstable and can therefore rise more easily, which allows the hurricane to form and maintain its shape. And thanks to La Ni\u00f1a, there isn\u2019t much wind shear\u2014the wind\u2019s speed and direction are fairly uniform at different elevations\u2014\u2018so the storm can stay nice and vertically stacked,\u2019 Kim Wood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona, told me. \u2018All of that combined is making the storm more efficient at using the energy available.\u2019 In other words, the storm very efficiently became a major danger \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMilton is also a very compact storm with a highly symmetrical, circular core, Wood said. In contrast, Helene\u2019s core took longer to coalesce, and the storm stayed more spread out. Wind speeds inside Milton picked up by about 90 miles an hour in a single day, intensifying faster than any other storm on record besides Hurricanes Wilma in 2005 and Felix in 2007. Climate scientists have worried for a while now that climate change could produce storms that intensify faster and reach higher peak intensities, given an extra boost by climate change. Milton is doing just that.\u201d\n\nRead more here: [https://theatln.tc/kyWsw7AN](https://theatln.tc/kyWsw7AN)\u00a0",

Because your job, your freedom, and your future are all dependent on the kindness and generosity of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n  \nWhat happens on Nov. 5 will go a long way toward determining whether Phoenix will be a habitable city in the years to come, whether\u00a0wildfires\u00a0will consume the West, whether the ocean will become a dead pool of jellyfish and coastal cities like Miami and Charleston become underwater theme parks.\n\nMaybe you love Kamala. Maybe not. Maybe you\u2019re cynical about politics and think it doesn\u2019t really matter who is president. Maybe you don\u2019t want to vote for her because of the ongoing horrors in Gaza. Or maybe you wish that she didn\u2019t play footsie with frackers and was a fiercer advocate of the promise (and the inevitability) of the clean energy revolution.But we live in the world we have, not the world we wish for. And in this world, the job of making sure Donald Trump is not the next president of the United States could not be more urgent.\u00a0\n\nTRUMP THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE is a hoax. He makes jokes about sea-level rise creating more oceanfront real estate and how wind turbines kill birds and whales.\n\nTrump is running a pro-climate chaos campaign. To him, a superheated planet is a feature, not a bug. Think about this way: The more chaotic our world becomes, the easier it is for him to stoke fear, build walls, deploy the military, and cosplay the Strong Man.\u00a0\n\nHarris\u2019s record on climate is strong. She has called climate change \u201can existential threat.\u201d As California attorney general, she prosecuted oil companies for environmental violations.\n\n\u201cThe science is clear,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cExtreme weather will only get worse, and the climate crisis will only accelerate.\u2019\u2019\u00a0\n\nA vote for Kamala Harris ... is a vote to save ourselves.",

She\u2019s been a driving force in delivering the strongest climate action in history, and she\u2019s ready to build on those gains from day one as president.\n  \nTwo years ago this summer, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote that secured U.S. Senate passage\nof the strongest climate action in history \u2013 climate and clean energy incentives worth at least $370 billion over 10 years in the Inflation Reduction Act. She has also been a driving force to ensure that the solutions are equitable and address the unfair pollution and health burdens that our nation\u2019s front-line communities have suffered.\n  \nHarris has worked for environmental justice for two decades, starting after she was elected district attorney for San Francisco and, later, attorney general for California. She created one of the first environmental justice units in San Francisco and held oil companies and automakers accountable for their pollution.\n  \nFormer President Trump, on the other hand, waged the worst White House attack ever against\nthe environment and public health while in office. And he has made clear that his second term will be even more extreme, drawing from the detailed anti-environment proposals and plans contained in Project 2025. Every vote for Dr. Jill Stein or Cornel West instead of Kamala Harris makes it more likely that Donald Trump will win.\n  \nWe share your commitment to a safe and healthy environment for all and thank Stein and West\nfor raising important issues in this election, but Vice President Harris is the only candidate with a\nrecord of success addressing climate change. Please join us in voting for the Harris-Walz ticket and against the Trump-Vance pro-polluter ticket.\n  \nSincerely,  \n350 Action  \nCenter for Biological Diversity Action Fund  \nClimate Emergency Advocates  \nEarthjustice Action  \nFood and Water Action  \nFriends of the Earth Action  \nLeague of Conservation Voters  \nNRDC Action Fund  \nSierra Club  \nSunrise Movement",

Our public utility board is elected, the majority of the board are up for reelection in 2024 (3/5 members). It currently has a republican majority (4/5) who voted to gut energy efficiency rules, eliminate our renewable energy standard, and raise prices for consumers on rooftop solar.\u00a0\n\nWe have three candidates, if elected, who would reverse the trend, foster more renewable energy, phase out coal, and give ratepayers relief from rate increases. They have been campaigning hard, building connections across communities in our state, and stand a reasonable chance of getting elected. We need all three elected. If we just get one or two, there will be no climate change mitigation for Arizona.\u00a0\n\nAnd then we have the greens\u2026\u00a0\n\nThe Green Party, despite having a race with three open seats, fielded two candidates. Their campaigns have been absolutely non-serious. They have not had campaign events, they did not provide candidate statements through Arizona Clean Elections mailers, they did not provide cover photos, they did not set up a website. What they did do is set up a Facebook page one month before the election. The content mentions climate change as an important issue, then talks about Gaza and Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine, issues that resonate with progressives, but have nothing to do with public utility regulation.\u00a0\n\nMy fear is that all the get out the vote efforts will lead to more green votes, causing republicans to get the plurality and win the election. People will see a Facebook post with nice statements, and vote for a choice designed to redirect them from supporting serious candidates who will make meaningful contributions if elected.\u00a0\n\nDo not vote green. No politician ever acted the way you wanted because you made a protest vote. A vote for green is a vote for big oil, fracking, and indefinite coal use. They are an absolute mess, run completely non-serious campaigns designed to tip elections in favor of fossil fuel candidates, and a complete disaster for climate.\u00a0",

                "Content": ">\u00a0Effects could be varied and wide-ranging. In a 2009 experiment in the southwest Atlantic Ocean by German and Indian scientists, larger zooplankton ate the smaller phytoplankton\u2014and little carbon actually reached the deep sea. In an experiment that was conducted in 2006 in the northeastern Pacific by researchers in the U.S. and Canada, toxic phytoplankton species\u00a0flourished. This has raised fears that fertilization could create \u201cdead zones\u201d where rampant algal blooms would consume all the oxygen in the water, snuffing out other life. Phytoplankton blooms could also consume nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen that then wouldn\u2019t be available for organisms elsewhere, a phenomenon known as \u201cnutrient robbing.\u201d In addition, scientists still know little about the deep-ocean ecosystems where the carbon is supposed to be stored. \u201cMost likely [iron fertilization] will affect something that we don\u2019t really understand yet,\u201d says deep-sea expert Lisa Levin of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who is not involved in the ExOIS program. Last year a\u00a0computer modeling study\u00a0done by British, American and French researchers found that adding one million to two million metric tons of iron into the ocean each year could draw down 45 billion metric tons of carbon by 2100. It would also rob nutrients from other sea life, however. Along with an estimated 15 percent reduction in marine biomass caused by warming, another 5 percent could be lost because of iron fertilization, particularly in fishing areas near the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian coasts. \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen [ExOIS] present a hypothesis of what\u2019s wrong with previous work ... that either makes the carbon yield higher or minimizes the negative consequences,\u201d says Alessandro Tagliabue of the University of Liverpool in England, co-lead author of that study.",

I'm still riding despite a few days of snow we had recently. That snow is all gone already! I'm sure we're going to get some more sloppy weather in January and February but if that's it then that's not too bad. 2 months out of the year certainly beats the 6 or 7 I'm accustomed to in terms of riding weather and conditions.\n\nWhen I was a young lad, snowstorms started in October and the snow hills were so big I'd dig tunnels in them and make snow forts. I've never seen my kids do this. The tunnels we made were so big sometimes a full grown adult could stand in them. It boggles my mind that people think global warming is a myth.

                "Content": "In 2016, Jill Stein helped Donald Trump win the election. She won 132,000 votes in the decisive swing states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania \u2014 while Trump\u2019s margin of victory was just 77,000 votes in those same states. \n  \nWhen confronted about being a spoiler for Trump, [Stein remained unapologetic](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/20/jill-stein-green-party-no-regrets-2016-215281) and said she doesn\u2019t have second thoughts. She has said it\u2019s a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d to be blamed for Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and considers it a \u201c[great honor](https://youtu.be/xbjq0I98Hd8)\u201d to be compared to Ralph Nader and his spoiler campaign. Her campaign surrogates admit she has [no path to victory](https://x.com/keithedwards/status/1843301144577405311) and that their top priority is [stopping Kamala Harris](https://x.com/keithedwards/status/1844109702764036515).\n  \nReporting from The Wall Street Journal and [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/09/23/jill-stein-paid-100000-to-a-consulting-firm-led-by-a-suspected-january-6-rioter/) revealed how the Stein campaign used a Republican consulting firm to help her get on the ballot, and in a recent court case in Nevada, Stein was represented by Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Jay Sekulow. \n  \nStein has had [troubling ties to Vladimir Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696) and her spoiler campaign benefitted from a Russian disinformation campaign in 2016. A [Senate Intelligence Committee](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html) report found that Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein. Additionally, the [Mueller Report](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/30/politics/jill-stein-russia-documents-senate-request/index.html) found that the Kremlin\u2019s Internet Research Agency used social media, including paid Facebook ads, to promote Stein\u2019s candidacy. On June 22, 2024, Trump held a rally in Philadelphia, PA where he said [\u201cJill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them.\u201d](https://www.c-span.org/video/?536453-1/president-trump-holds-rally-philadelphia)",

I also sucked it up and voted for Clinton in 2016. But this impulse to just blame everyone and anyone for the failures of the Democratic Party and HRC is truly maddening. HRC ran one of the worst GenElection campaigns I have ever seen. She came out of a deeply contentious primary with a Policy wonk to her Left; stopped talking substantive policy the moment he dropped out; did absolutely nothing herself to try to consolidate her own base, taking the stance of \"ehh, where else they gonna go?\"; and then spent the VAST majority of the following 3 months courting \"Moderate Republican\" Donors. As she sprinted right as fast as she could the moment Sanders was no longer forcing her left. Then the Dems learned absolutely nothing from it; blaming everything and anything else but themselves for the loss.\n\nThe Dems are a Center Right/Moderate Right Corporate party on everything but a handful of cheap to take stances on Left Leaning ID politics they're never the leaders on. They are certainly better than the alternative, but that bar is so insanely low it is not an accomplishment. On top of this, a Centrist Party beholden to the same donors as the Right Wing Party, only really exist to give more political power to their opposition by-design. By throwing most of their bargaining power away at the door, before the bargaining even begins. While this doctrine of \"Practical Incrementalism\" they preach just falls apart the moment one realizes that the other side have never been Incrementalists. Explaining the consistent, incremental march further to the right for decades on most topics on the Overton Window. To the point \"Feeding School Kids\", \"Climate Change is real\", and \"Codifying Womens rights the nation has gone 50 years backwards on\" is \"Progressive\"?\n\nSo ... Stein sucks.  But screw the Dems for sitting in their comfort space of apparent Dick Cheney levels of Right Wing war criminals now. I'll begrudgingly vote Harris, but I'm not going to sit here and get culty and defensive over a party that absolutely shares accountability for both Trump's successes AND fostering an environment in which \"Trumps\" could thrive. In a two party state, BOTH parties hold accountability for failure of state; while struggling so much to beat Trump of all people only reflects the Dem's weakness.  Plus, I'd guess most voters voting Stein would never have voted Clinton/Harris. They'd probably have stayed home. Lets stop pretending \"those Green votes where the Dem's property\" to avoid holding the Dems accountable for their own failures.  Due to their lack of vision, to tow their own deeply conservative donor lines.",

                "Content": "new ending: \n\n# Part 3: A New Paradigm of Rapid Regeneration and Growing Energy Demand\n\nThe Net Zero activists and Ted Kaczinsky fail to see that a rapid rise of AI has transformed global energy dynamics, creating unprecedented opportunities to rethink energy production. With AI energy demand projected to grow exponentially, what might initially seem like a burden becomes an opportunity to scale sustainable, renewable energy infrastructure. Unlike previous eras of industrial expansion that heavily relied on fossil fuels, this moment offers the chance to align energy growth with ecological restoration.\n\n# 1. AI-Driven Energy Innovation:\n\nAI itself can be a key driver of energy efficiency and sustainability. From optimizing solar panel placements to enhancing grid management with predictive algorithms, AI technologies are enabling faster deployment of renewables. The sheer demand for energy to power AI systems\u2014akin to a modern industrial revolution\u2014is spurring investment in scalable solutions like solar farms, wind power, and advanced battery storage. This demand-driven growth creates economies of scale, making clean energy cheaper and more accessible.\n\n# 2. Ecological Restoration as a Balancing Act:\n\nWhile energy expansion is necessary to meet AI-driven growth, it must be paired with ecological restoration to offset environmental impacts. Technologies like reforestation drones, bioengineered carbon sinks, and AI-assisted land rehabilitation can restore habitats and capture carbon emissions. For example, regions undergoing renewable energy infrastructure development can simultaneously implement restoration projects, such as wetland reconstruction or rewilding efforts, ensuring that energy growth contributes to ecological health rather than harm.\n\n# 3. Energy for Restoration:\n\nAI-driven energy innovation doesn\u2019t just meet human needs\u2014it can also directly fuel ecological restoration. Clean energy sources can power desalination plants for reforesting arid regions, support biotechnological breakthroughs in soil regeneration, and sustain large-scale carbon removal projects. The synergy between energy abundance and restoration efforts creates a virtuous cycle: energy expansion supports ecological repair, and healthy ecosystems enhance climate resilience.\n\n# 4. A Future of Abundance and Balance:\n\nThis new paradigm doesn\u2019t ask humanity to shrink its ambitions or retreat from progress. Instead, it invites us to grow intelligently\u2014leveraging technological innovation to harmonize energy needs with environmental stewardship. AI\u2019s rising energy demand can become the catalyst for a new era of sustainable abundance, where human advancement and ecological health are no longer at odds. By meeting energy challenges head-on while actively restoring the planet, we can turn a potential crisis into a transformative opportunity.\n\nThis paradigm aligns human progress with ecological health, embracing technology as a tool for both growth and restoration. Unlike Kaczynski\u2019s vision of dismantling industrial society or the sustainability movement\u2019s calls for restraint, rapid regeneration and energy abundance offer a hopeful middle path.",

                "Content": "And rather ironically, a cooling of the North Atlantic would actually result in substantially hotter and drier summers in Western Europe. Various studies demonstrate this so-called cold-ocean-warm-summer feedback, with the more recent Oltmanns, Holliday et al. (2024) study warning that a severely hot and dry summer is imminent in northern and western Europe based on current subpolar SST cooling anomalies. Bischof, Kedzierski et al. (2023) also demonstrated the link between a strong cooling of the North Atlantic and the hot and dry summer of 2018 in the UK, with Rousi, Kornhuber et al. demonstrating the link between cold subpolar SSTs and atmospheric anomalies over northwestern Europe. Similarly, Whan, Zscheischler et al. demonstrate a strong correlation between soil moisture deficits and greater heat anomalies across Europe. Maritime Europe is particularly susceptible to changes in rainfall accumulation and this often results in more intense heatwaves and drought concerns, which create a self-perpetuating feedback based on these metrics. Observations by Schenk, V\u00e4liranta et al. (2018) and Bromley, Putnam et al. (2018) both demonstrated that this higher seasonality response occured during the Younger Dryas event, with Bromley's team demonstrating the warmer summer response in Scotland specifically. Considering that this warmer summer feedback was observable under glacial maximum conditions, it would be fair to assume that a substantial bias for warming would occur should it happen under current conditions.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the severe cooling feedback hypothesis is very out of date. It's based on an idealized preindustrial 1750 baseline of <300ppm and assume a very linear assumption of the hypothetical atmospheric response to changes in thermohaline circulation.  Subsequent atmospheric dynamics are severely underestimated by the current model methodology, with Rahmstorf et al. (2015) discussing this discrepancy in relation to CMIP outputs. Observations by Vautard, Cattiaux et al. demonstrated that warming rates in Western Europe have been disproportionate when compared to computer reconstructions, due to said models not accounting for atmospheric feedbacks. Proxy-based assumptions don't account for factors such as the substantially different conditions of the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interglacial to Younger Dryas reversal analog; the B/A interglacial already saw substantial continental glaciers in Northern Europe and North America - the Fennoscandinavian and Laurentide respectively - and a considerably lower atmospheric carbon volume, which sat around 190-200ppm. These conditions almost certainly exacerbated the cooling response to hypothetical AMOC collapse of that era. But needless to say, these conditions don't apply to the Anthropocene. For all intents and purposes, ~300ppm was the stable threshold for Arctic cryospheric stability, as we hadn't breached 300ppm for 800,000 years prior to industrialization. It was within this period that the Arctic achieved stable year-round glaciation.\n\nAt >420ppm, we're broadly analogous to the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period. Anthropocene albedo forcing continues to crash from its already fatally low levels, with the Arctic region entering a stage where it can no longer advect surplus heat efficiently. Factors such as darkening ice are already initiating an accelerative feedback and Arctic marine heatwave anomalies are being sustained by greenhouse gas forcing. Present atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are more conductive to trapping more heat and we're currently seeing carbon levels rise at an unprecedented rate, up to ten times faster than the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which is considered a potential analog for our near future climate. Atmospheric methane volumes suggest that we've been analogous to an ice age termination event for almost 20 years already, and a hypothetical AMOC collapse actually risks a substantial collapse of oceanic carbon sinks and potentially risks carbon outgassing. If that wasn't bad enough, there's a distinct risk of methane hydrate destabilization specifically in relation to AMOC weakening. \n\nI've studied this particular subject for a few years now by conducting a cross-analysis approach and will hopefully publish my research next year (risk doxxing myself here). AMA if anyone wants to learn more about this angle.",

So, you can keep protesting all you want, but unless people that want to combat climate change actually get put into positions of power, then all you're doing is temporarily getting some attention for yourself while the major polluters get to keep doing whatever they want.",

His own words illustrate why it was going to be difficult.\n\n*As for why so many people still resist what the facts clearly show, I think, in part, the reason is that the truth about the climate crisis is an inconvenient one that means* ***we are going to have to change the way we live our lives.***\n\nWhat's happened since 2006?  Cars have gotten bigger, and we're buying more of the larger vehicles and driving them more miles.  Air travel has increased, from 2 billion passengers in 2006 to almost 5 billion now.  Cruise ships have increased, with the industry building bigger and bigger ships to keep up with demand, and they still can't build them fast enough.  Houses got bigger, requiring more energy to heat/cool them.  Our consumption of meat increased.  We shop more than we used to, buying more and more useless stuff -- things like fast fashion, which have been around since at least the 1990s, has exploded over the last 10-15 years.\n\nAnything you can think of that constituted our way of life in 2006 has been cranked up to 11.\n\nAnd then add in new stuff, like the explosive growth of the internet, which was tame in 2006 compared to now -- streaming, social media, gaming, AI.  \n\nA year after the book was published, the first iPhone was released, which kicked off an arms race of people constantly upgrading their smartphones, whether or not there was a need to do so.\n\nI could go on, but really -- why?\n\nA lot of people will point the finger at capitalism, that catch-all term that collectively describes the sellers, but everyone who can afford to do so is eagerly buying every single thing capitalism has to offer.",

But a law passed during the first Trump administration required the federal government to hold two lease sales there for fossil fuel drilling. The first was in 2021 and was ultimately suspended and canceled by the Interior Department because of the lack of interest from the oil industry.\n\nThe Trump-era law required the second lease sale to be held before the end of 2024. The Biden administration signaled Wednesday it plans to move forward with a 400,000-acre auction \u2014 the lowest acreage it could legally offer.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the many ways the White House and administration are trying to protect some of Biden\u2019s biggest accomplishments while president, including his vast portfolio of action on climate change and the environment.\u201d",

When the factory farmers around us (we are small, non commercial meat) were harvesting their corn crop this summer it filled the air and streets with so much dust and dirt it cut visibility. Right now our cattle are drinking so much water each day because they are subsiding on dry hay and dry grass, making them parched and so our well water is running on overdrive each day. Who knows what our garden will be able to provide this summer since we don't use pesticides and we only plan to use a simple drip irrigation system, if that. I try telling people this but all they tell me is how great that 70\u00b0 October was. Goddamn fools.\n\nEdit: spelling mistake",

She was saying that it was getting drier and drier and she can't grow apples any more. Now that whole region has burned away with the giant western wildfires. \n\nScientists were warning about the entire region going up in flames because warm air holds more moisture. Think of a giant sponge moving over the world. That's our atmosphere. It sucks up water from one area and drops it elsewhere. If it holds more moisture then that means that the dry regions will get  drier, and the wet ones will have massive dumps of water or snow. That was what was predicted 40 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago .... and we see it, exactly as predicted. \n\nIt was the cause of the Syrian refugee crisis as farmers could no longer grow. \n\nWe are on the verge of global food crises and climate migrants. \n\nThanks, unethical billionaires for funding partisanship leading to the collapse of science and politicians who make money denying climate change ...

I find it utterly infuriating when moderate Democrats think that they need to pay lip service to a toxic destructive climate monster of an industry to win Pennsylvania. I don\u2019t actually think that is true, because studies have shown that 70 percent of Pennsylvania residents want fracking either banned or much more tightly regulated.\n\nBut I don\u2019t need to be in love. I need to be able to vote strategically.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people showed up to protect this place and to hold moderate Democrats accountable, and that was the key to victory here.\n\n*You know who didn\u2019t show up for this place? Jill Stein. She doesn\u2019t show up for these frontline battles.

For Stein to ignore all this and still attempt to call herself an activist is beyond hypocrisy, it is political malpractice. Shame on you, Dr. Stein! Shame on you for profiting from fracking and oil drilling.*\n\nI\u2019m not in love with Kamala Harris\u2019s positions\u2014on fracking, and on some other issues. But I will tell you what I am in love with. I\u2019m in love with our movements.\n\nI\u2019m in love with what we can do. The entire history of progressive progress in this country is of movements pushing moderate presidents. It happened with FDR and the labor movement. It happened with LBJ and the MLK and the civil rights movement. It happened with Obama and Biden and the movement for gay marriage. We organize and push them\u2014and that\u2019s how we get what we want. That\u2019s our progressive history in America.\n\nBut in order for us progressives to do our jobs and fight effectively for a more just and equitable world as a movement, we need to have Harris in office. If we have Donald Trump in office, there\u2019s no chance in hell that we\u2019re actually going to advance an environmental agenda.\n\nSo I urge you to please believe in us as a movement. Love us. Believe in our power. We have done this before\u2014and we can do it again with a moderate Democrat in office. Which is the only choice we\u2019ve got right now.\n\nIf everyone in who voted for Stein in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan had voted for the Democrat instead, Trump would never have been the president.\n\nWe have the true power. It comes from the bottom up.\n\nAnd I believe in us.\n\nA vote for Harris is a vote for us, a vote for our movements to have a fighting chance for change. Progressive politics and advancing our agenda in this country is not something that happens every four years when you vote, or every four years when a toxic egomaniac like Stein (or Trump, for that matter) runs for president. It is a daily commitment. So vote for Kamala Harris. Join the movement\u2014and I\u2019ll see you on the front lines.\"",

But first, a little history\u2026\n\nNot long ago the entire upper Delaware River basin in Pennsylvania\u2014one of the most beautiful areas in the country, in the watershed for New York City, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia\u2014was on the chopping block for fracking.\n\nA 75 mile stretch of the Delaware River could have become a toxic oil field. Fracking is an environmental apocalypse: millions of gallons of toxic fracking fluids, radioactive waste, underground water contamination, hundreds of thousands of truck trips, air pollution, land scarring, massive public health crises, and depleted water supply. Everything about the practice is toxic; it is inherently contaminating in the long and short term.\n\nOur community was quick to understand the threat and organize and mobilize against it. Every little town along the Delaware across New York and Pennsylvania had a mom-and-pop anti-fracking group spring up. My film Gasland, on HBO, was part of this campaign, and our Gasland tours went from town to town, Johnny Appleseed\u2013style, fostering our new movement.\n\nAmazingly, we won. We banned fracking in the Delaware River basin and in New York State, saving the water supply for 16 million people. One of the greatest achievements of the environmental movement in this century.\n\nWe did this by convincing the Democratic governors of New York and Delaware and the president at the time\u2014Barack Obama\u2014to ban fracking here. These were all moderate Democrats. Not exactly Bernie Sanders, if you know what I mean.\n\nRepublicans would have just said no. This whole place would have been completely fracked to hell. We would have lost. And the whole gorgeous, life-giving national treasure of the Delaware River would have been a toxic fracking zone.\n\nOur victory against fracking kept more carbon and methane in the ground than almost any other single environmental win in history\u2014making it a huge win for the climate as well.\"",

About how extraordinary our existence is and how other life forms on the planet are our literal family. About how we're living in a vast billions of years old universe, and are sandwiched in-between billions of years worth of time ... So what do I care what people think of me and how they feel about how outspoken I'm becoming? Look at all the problems that exist. Do people think things are just gonna \"pan out\"? They think they lead unfulfilling lives now well just wait. All the movies and music and restaurants and concerts and get togethers in the world aren't gonna be able to take them out of their heads knowing that everything is falling apart and isn't right.

And, what do you know, lead fulfilling lives doing things of meaning in the process. Creating a healthy world, like??? It's all RIGHT THERE. How can we continue in our detrimental ways?

                "Content": ">Another fact that makes Helene\u2019s devastation so unprecedented is that almost none of those hundreds of billions of dollars in losses will be paid out by insurance. While the storm caused most of its damage through flooding, which is covered under a government-run flood insurance program, very few residents of the southern Appalachian mountains hold flood policies \u2014 even those who live in federally designated flood zones. As of now, these storm victims in North Carolina and Tennessee have no guarantee of comprehensive public or private assistance as they try to piece their lives back together. \n\nDomestic climate refugees.\n\nIf they weren't insured or were underinsured, insurance won't cover it. The small towns don't have the resources to rebuild. I doubt that states would pour a significant percentage of their GDP into rebuilding, nor would the federal government. And even if the latter two did, how many times could they do it?\n\nCan they stay in the ruins of their towns and eke out a marginal life? Will they move? Where to? Into what housing? What jobs will they find?\n\nDroughts, heat waves, storms, hurricanes, floods, rising sea levels... the \"FO\" phase of climate change is here, and we're not ready for it.",

        "Content": "I feel like the window for climate change reversal is closed, and conversation should focus on adjusting to the changes rather than reversing them. \n\nI don't get to talk to anyone about this, so I think I am just trying to get my own thoughts out. I could be wrong, and I am open to changing my thoughts.\n\nFirst, the overall discussion of Milton is very doomsday-ish. Yes, it's a monster, but we will recover and we will adjust. Claiming Cat 5's will be the new normal is just the opposite side of the same coin of people thinking you can steer hurricanes. There is so much wrong with both, you don't even know where to start. I feel like climate change conversations are the same. The storm is here. We should talk about how to live with it - not how to undo it.\n\nNext, many of the trigger points have already reached critical moments that we are still hoping are reversible. Really, how in the world would we speed up global ocean currents - after 50+ years of slowing them down? And that is just 1 of the many large systems that are at this point - much less the dozens of smaller ones.\n\nThe Antarctic ice has been extremely, record-breaking low 2 years in a row! How many sub-systems stalled for that to happen? Do we even know of them all? Sure, the Antarctic waxes and wanes, but but never to this degree. Its done - that ice is never coming back to the same levels.\n\nAlso, the world's largest fossil fuel deposit was just discovered near those waters. There is a treaty keeping countries from drilling, but that expires in 20 years, so good luck keeping companies out of there. \n\nSpeaking of carbon dioxide, for some reason people tried to cling to the smokes and mirrors that Covid brought down carbon emissions AND the world started improving. Sorry, the record low ice levels where after Covid, the oceans currents continued to decline, and methane from the permafrost never stopped. Too many gears are turning too quickly at this point. \n\nIf I smoked for 70 years, and I got lung cancer, then reducing my smoking for 2 years isn't going to do anything. Too many systems have failed. It's done.\n\nThere is no putting methane back in the permafrost, so thats already a run-away system. This change is due to 50+ years of actions leading in that direction, so even slowing it down is not possible. \n\nI don't need to mention wars, war-tactics, and the local environments, because it's obvious. Plus, for those people in those regions, I cannot blame (you can't worry about scarring when you are on fire). However, I wonder how many Tesla need to replace gasoline vehicles to make up for a sinking tanker or destroyed oilfield? \n\nThen we have solar energy, which has been scammed onto most homes through companies, promising lower bills, cashing out government subsidies, sub-contracting 15 layers of sevices to the point you don't know who to contact if your battery dies - hopefully, before the company folds, renames itself, and pops back with a new, updated scam terms. However, this behavior is having a cultural effect - people are losing trust in the entire idea of switching to solar energy.\n\nRecycling is a joke that doesn't even need to be discussed at the moment. Between, Africa, China, and a few other countries, recycling just means, \"I want this trash really, really far away.\", and some companies charge you an extra $250 a quarter for it. Pass.\n\nI don't want to get too far into the weeds when it comes to people and understanding, but you have the so many who think we are pushing a 700-mile wide storm around, and others think that oceans are going to be 3-feet higher in 10 years. And that is just raw ignorance, not even monetarily motivated ignorance. Its not been until very recently that people have become accepting of nuclear energy. Until we see a global crisis in our face, then this is not going to change.\n\nI don't know. Sorry if this isn't the place for random thoughts, but I feel like we are too far gone. I feel like we are wasting time and money talking about sucking carbon dioxide out of the air, when conversation should start focusing how to adjust to how Earth is changing.\n\n",

                "Content": "Hi all, I hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think. Here's how it starts:\n\n>*\u201cTell them stories. They need the truth. You must tell them true stories, and everything will be well.\u201d*\n\n>*So says the ghost of an old woman to nun-turned-astrophysicist Mary Malone in \u201cThe Amber Spyglass,\u201d the final tome in Philip Pullman\u2019s \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d trilogy and one of my favorite novels. The admonition came to mind as I explored an unusual art exhibit at the USC\u2019s Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, two dozen miles off the Southern California coast.*\n\n>*A series of 11 images envisions a sustainable future for Los Angeles \u2014 as dreamed up by artificial intelligence.*\n\n>*One image shows a downtown streetscape, shaded by overhead walkways teeming with vegetation. Another adds solar panels to the hillsides beneath the Hollywood sign. Several contemplate vibrant futures for the L.A. River, tearing out\u00a0concrete flood-control straitjackets\u00a0along its banks and reviving the waterway with abundant plants and wildlife, as well as walking paths.*\n\n>*One especially mind-bending picture replaces cars with bicycles on a freeway along the river.*\n\n>*Are any of these visions realistic? Does it matter if they could ever be \u201ctrue\u201d?*\n\n>*And how should we feel about the fact that shadowy computer brains played a role in creating them?*\n\n>*I posed those questions to Allison Agsten, the art curator at USC\u2019s Wrigley Institute for Environment and Sustainability. She also leads the Center for Climate Journalism and Communication at USC\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and she oversaw development of the sustainable L.A. exhibit. She has mixed feelings about artificial intelligence herself.*\n\n>*\u201cThis installation represents an experiment,\u201d Agsten said.*\n\n>*And not always a smooth one, she was quick to acknowledge.*\n\n>*Catalina Island has been\u00a0plagued by invasive mule deer, which were introduced by humans in the 1930s for hunting. According to the Catalina Island Conservancy, the nonnative deer destroy natural habitats, increasing fire risk and harming native animals.*\n\n>*But when USC cinematic arts professor Kathy Smith and three grad students asked their AI programs, which\u00a0included\u00a0Midjourney and OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E, to dream up a sustainable Catalina, one of the programs created an image of \u201ca flourishing deer population,\u201d Agsten recalled \u2014 seemingly tricked by all the online discussion into thinking that more deer would be good, not terrible.*\n\n>*\u201cI said \\[to the students\\], let\u2019s talk about why that image isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Agsten told me.*\n\n>*The invasive mule deer didn\u2019t make the exhibit. Neither did various other digital fever dreams, from some that Agsten described as \u201cdark and apocalyptic\u201d to others that she called \u201csome of our absolutely most radical depictions\u201d of a future Los Angeles.*\n\n>*I know just enough about artificial intelligence to be worried \u2014 but not enough to know how worried I should be.*\n\n>*In the hands of Google and Meta, the technology\u00a0threatens the news business, by taking journalism produced by people like me and handing it out for free (after occasionally mangling it to the point where it\u2019s no longer accurate). The data centers that power AI consume\u00a0huge amounts of energy and water.\u00a0Also bad: Liars can use AI to create images that distort reality for nefarious ends, such as tricking people into thinking that national parks have been\u00a0overrun by migrant tent camps. (They have not.)*\n\n>*So why turn to potentially dystopian tech to envision a better future? Why not let Smith and her students flex their creativity?*\n\nAgain, I hope you'll read the whole piece and share you're thoughts!

And even though Boomers want to deny climate change they can't deny that they were taught about the effects of the collapse by the Atlantic Gulf stream in grade school. \n\nThat was basically their climate and weather education. Learning about the Gulf stream and how it affected the United States East Coast and Gulf of mexico. How important it was to all of our weather systems.\n\nIt's like the one climate issue in the news that's actually making sense to them. But too little too late unfortunately.\n\nI basically told him we have no choice but to let the Atlantic Gulf stream collapse because we are too busy trying to solve a dozen other climate issues that are out of control. And rather than abandon all of those efforts and focus on the Gulf stream the best we can do is just let it fail and adapt to it. Because there's no stopping it from happening.\n\nHe said that was completely stupid. That we can't just let the Gulfstream collapse.\n\nI told him it was stupid that his generation ignore the problem for so long that it got to this point\n\nSilence",

Yes there was war/strife/power struggles but there are countless examples of the opposite being true as well.  There is a stark shift we can see during the capitalist era compared to the rest of history, and that\u2019s hard to ignore.  \n\nI do agree we have made lazy/poor choices collectively, but in part this is also due to manipulation and being lied to, as well as giving in to our vices for comfort.  We\u2019re addicted to our lifestyle and we have a responsibility for that, at the same time we were lied and encouraged to do that so companies could profit off it.  Oil and Gas companies have lied for decades about the effects of fossil fuels, we were told from the near onset that plastic was fine as long as it was recycled, another known lie, hell we were even told smoking was good for us.  If there was ethics and accountability involved, I think it would be a very different world.",

                "Content": "Hi all, hope you'll read my latest climate deep dive for the L.A. Times and let me know what you think. Here's how it starts:\n\n>*In the early morning light, it\u2019s easy to mistake the towering gray mounds for an odd-looking mountain range \u2014 pale and dull and devoid of life, some pine trees and shrublands in the foreground with lazy blue skies extending up beyond the peaks.*\n\n>*But the mounds aren\u2019t mountains.*\n\n>*They\u2019re enormous piles of dirt, torn from the ground by crane-like machines called draglines to open paths to the rich coal seams beneath. And even though we\u2019re in rural southeastern Montana, more than 800 miles from the Pacific Ocean, West Coast cities are largely to blame for the destruction of this landscape.*\n\n>*Workers at the Rosebud Mine load coal onto a conveyor belt, which carries the planet-wrecking fuel to a power plant in the small town next door. Plant operators in Colstrip burn the coal to produce electricity, much of which is shipped by power line to homes and businesses in the Portland and Seattle areas. It\u2019s been that way for decades.*\n\n>*\u201cThe West Coast markets are what created this,\u201d Anne Hedges says, as we watch a dragline move dirt.*\n\n>*She sounds frustrated, and with good reason.*\n\n>*Hedges and her fellow Montana environmentalists were happy when Oregon and Washington passed laws requiring 100% clean energy in the next two decades. But they\u2019re furious that electric utilities in those states are planning to stick with coal for as long as the laws allow, and in some cases making deals to give away their Colstrip shares to co-owners who seem determined to keep the plant running long into the future.*\n\n>*\u201cCoal is not dead yet,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cIt\u2019s still alive and well.\u201d*\n\n>*That\u2019s an uncomfortable reality for West Coasters critical of red-state environmental policies but not in the habit of urging their politicians to work across state lines to change them \u2014 especially when doing so might involve compromise with Republicans.*\n\n>*One example: California lawmakers have*\u00a0[*refused to pass bills*](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2018/09/06/california-approves-100-climate-friendly-energy-punts-other-bills/1204451002/)\u00a0*that would make it easier to share clean electricity across the West, passing up the chance to spur renewable energy development in windy red states such as Montana and Wyoming \u2014 and to show them it\u2019s possible to create construction jobs and tax revenues with renewable energy, not just fossil fuels.*\n\n>*Instead, California has prioritized in-state wind and solar farms, bowing to the will of labor unions that want those jobs.*\n\n>*It\u2019s hard to blame Golden State politicians, and voters, for taking the easy path.*\n\n>*But global warming is a global problem \u2014 and whether we like it or not, the electric grid is a giant, interconnected machine. Coal plants in conservative states help fuel the ever-deadlier heat waves, fires and storms battering California and other progressive bastions. The electrons generated by those plants flow into a network of wires that keep the lights on across the American West.*\n\n>*Also important: Montana and other sparsely populated conservative states control two U.S. Senate seats each, and at least three electoral votes apiece in presidential elections. Additional federal support for clean energy rests partly in their hands.*\n\n>*Those are the practical considerations. Then there are the ethical ones.*\n\nAgain \u2014 that's just the beginning. Really hope you'll read the whole story and tell me what you think!",

The big recent push for this started around the time of Sir Francis Bacon and Descartes, the former of whom vivisected animals because they \u2018didn\u2019t really feel pain anyways and their screaming was just an instinctual reaction\u2019.  It laid the seed for this disconnect with the world around us, really as an attempt to justify acquisition.  There\u2019s a reason the First Nations people of North America thought that Europeans suffered from a mental illness and didn\u2019t grasp the concept fully of owning land, because those Westerners didn\u2019t have a respect for nature.\n\nThere are lots of detailed reports on this, this idea what we need to grow perpetually is a capitalist concept, in fact it\u2019s the core imperative of capitalism.  There are many books on the subject, I highly recommend Jason Hickel\u2019s work, Less is More and The Divide are both great deep dives into this.  It\u2019s great that there is a paper that *theorizes* something unprovable, but what I\u2019m suggesting is analytical and objective history.",

So this is good news in the sense that more ideas and concepts leads to more scalable and effective strategies - but we have to realize the vast majority of these things will amount to absolutely nothing.  \n\nI do think that targeting small amounts of carbon removal from everyday objects is worth looking at though.  It may end up being much more feasible than large expensive facilities.  I\u2019ve often thought that some form of low-energy passive carbon capture in furnaces/air conditioners has potential because we\u2019re already using energy to move the air for other purposes.  But of course, just like with the car, you\u2019ve got to be able to capture, hold, and ultimately sequester the carbon for it to be useful.

                "Content": "Let's see what the paper is about, because the clickbait title sound like clickbait.\n\n>How UA compares with conventional agriculture depends on the crops grown, growing systems and local climate3. It is unclear what forms of UA are environmentally friendly, because case studies of individual cities typically only assess one form of UA\n\nThis just sounds like they're discovering the problem of \"locavore\" footprint. Meaning that eating locally doesn't guarantee lower GHG emissions because the production processes can be more energy intensive or polluting than transportation from a place where those production processes are way less energy intensive and polluting.\n\n>Collective gardens are the most carbon-intensive form of UA (\u03bc\u2009=\u20090.81\u2009kgCO2e per serving, 7.50\u2009kgCO2e\u2009kg\u22121). Individual gardens and urban farms are similar on average (both produce 0.34\u2009kgCO2e per serving), but variation among urban farms leaves them statistically indistinguishable from conventional farms (P\u2009=\u20090.33). In fact, most urban farms are carbon-competitive with conventional farms (median\u2009=\u20090.08\u2009kgCO2e per serving when one particularly carbon-intensive urban farm is excluded from the analysis)\n\nIt's likely a measure of community resource investment with poor planning. Let's see.\n\n>Nonetheless, the average vegetable at the local grocer outperforms the average vegetable on UA sites in all five countries (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nProbably because professionals know how to produce more with less and reach economies of scale. \n\n>For example, the median urban tomato (0.17\u2009kgCO2e per serving) outperforms conventional tomatoes (\u03bc\u2009=\u20090.27\u2009kgCO2e per serving). Although, on average, urban tomatoes are more carbon-intensive than conventional tomatoes (P\u2009=\u20090.02), this low median demonstrates that UA sites often outperform conventional tomato growing. This is largely due to the carbon-intensive greenhouses that supply most tomatoes to our case cities, as well as sub-optimal distribution patterns of the crop from farm to city\n\nif you're growing tomatoes in an open garden, it means that you can grow tomatoes outside and you get free zero-carbon energy from the Sun. Such comparisons should not be made in the first place.\n\n>This suggests that urban food growers could maximize carbon benefits (or minimize carbon impacts) by selecting crops conventionally grown or distributed using carbon-intensive methods. \n\nYes, that's actually the case where transportation emissions are way worse.\n\n> Urban farms are most likely to be climate-friendly (43% of urban farm sites), followed by individual gardens (25% of sites).\n\nthe professionals win. I'm shocked.\n\n>neither environmental actions (for example, presence of solar panels) nor expressed values are predictive of carbon emissions (Supplementary Table 3)\n\nthis isn't a \"fake it till you make it\" situation.\n\n>We identify three best practices crucial to making low-tech UA carbon-competitive with conventional agriculture: (1) extend infrastructure lifetimes, (2) use urban waste as inputs and (3) generate high levels of social benefits.\n\nAll 3 are tied to professional/commercial efforts. Knowing how to build a long-lasting farm is part of a plan. Connecting urban waste and handling it also requires some extra means and know-how. Social benefits means especially that the harvest isn't just for a small minority, which also displaces supply from other sources.\n\n>Infrastructure is the largest driver of carbon emissions at low-tech UA sites (63% of impacts)\n\nYep. You can't use farms like sandboxes.\n\n>The carbon footprint of compost grows tenfold when methane-generating anaerobic conditions persist in compost piles39. This is common during small-scale composting, and home compost is the highest-impact input on 22 of the 73 UA sites studied (Supplementary Table 4). Cities can offset this risk by centralizing compost operations for professional management or by training farmers on proper composting practices\n\nKnowledge. (Otherwise, the compost bin is like the rumen of a cow.) \n\n>Instead, sites primarily used potable municipal water sources or groundwater wells, consistent with the underutilization of rainwater seen across past research9. Irrigation from these sources emits GHGs from pumping, water treatment and distribution, and this rose to as high as 83% of total emissions on one UA site\n\n*points at MULCHING IS OBLIGATORY sign*\n\n>UA practitioners overwhelmingly reported improved mental health, diets and social networks.\n\nIndeed, it's very nice.\n\n>This study takes a conservative approach by allocating all supplies and irrigation to food production, and infrastructure is allocated to food and social co-benefits based on interviews with farmers and standardized calculations (for example, 10% of a raised bed allocated to non-food if 10% of the area grows ornamentals).\n\nThat's fair. The only ornamental plants that should be used are the ones that can be mixed in to help, such as those that attract pollinators, spiders and so on.\n\n>Although this threshold appears high, evidence suggests this is attainable. Cost\u2013benefit analysis of a collective garden in the UK estimated that social benefits, such as improved well-being and reduced hospital admissions, accounted for 99.4% of total economic value generated on-site47. Because emissions allocation often follows economic value generation46, growing spaces that maximize social benefits can outcompete conventional agriculture when UA benefits are considered holistically.\n\nIndeed. They're describing the benefit of a type of park. Don't call it a farm, call it a \"food park\" or \"garden park\". \n\nThis paper is useless, it's not even comparing apples to oranges.",

They did this because climate stabilization means bringing fossil fuel use to approximately zero, and that would end their business.  That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.\n\nThere is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, and helps work out the kinks in new technologies. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
