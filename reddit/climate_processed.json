                "Content": "Zo\u00eb Schlanger: \u201cAs Hurricane Milton exploded from a Category 1 storm into a Category 5 storm over the course of 12 hours yesterday, climate scientists and meteorologists were stunned. NBC6\u2019s John Morales, a veteran TV meteorologist in South Florida, choked up on air while describing how quickly and dramatically the storm had intensified. To most people, a drop in pressure of 50 millibars means nothing; a weatherman understands, as Morales said mid-broadcast, that \u2018this is just horrific.\u2019 Florida is still cleaning up from Helene; this storm is spinning much faster, and it\u2019s more compact and organized.\n\n\u201cIn a way, Milton is exactly the type of storm that scientists have been warning could happen; Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, called it shocking but not surprising. \u2018One of the things we know is that, in a warmer world, the most intense storms are more intense,\u2019 he told me. Milton might have been a significant hurricane regardless, but every aspect of the storm that could have been dialed up has been.\n\n\u201cA hurricane forms from multiple variables, and in Milton, the variables have come together to form a nightmare. The storm is gaining considerable energy thanks to high sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which is far hotter than usual. And that energy translates into higher wind speeds. Milton is also taking up moisture from the very humid atmosphere, which, as a rule, can hold 7 percent more water vapor for every degree-Celsius increase in temperature. Plus, the air is highly unstable and can therefore rise more easily, which allows the hurricane to form and maintain its shape. And thanks to La Ni\u00f1a, there isn\u2019t much wind shear\u2014the wind\u2019s speed and direction are fairly uniform at different elevations\u2014\u2018so the storm can stay nice and vertically stacked,\u2019 Kim Wood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona, told me. \u2018All of that combined is making the storm more efficient at using the energy available.\u2019 In other words, the storm very efficiently became a major danger \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMilton is also a very compact storm with a highly symmetrical, circular core, Wood said. In contrast, Helene\u2019s core took longer to coalesce, and the storm stayed more spread out. Wind speeds inside Milton picked up by about 90 miles an hour in a single day, intensifying faster than any other storm on record besides Hurricanes Wilma in 2005 and Felix in 2007. Climate scientists have worried for a while now that climate change could produce storms that intensify faster and reach higher peak intensities, given an extra boost by climate change. Milton is doing just that.\u201d\n\nRead more here: [https://theatln.tc/kyWsw7AN](https://theatln.tc/kyWsw7AN)\u00a0",

Because your job, your freedom, and your future are all dependent on the kindness and generosity of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n  \nWhat happens on Nov. 5 will go a long way toward determining whether Phoenix will be a habitable city in the years to come, whether\u00a0wildfires\u00a0will consume the West, whether the ocean will become a dead pool of jellyfish and coastal cities like Miami and Charleston become underwater theme parks.\n\nMaybe you love Kamala. Maybe not. Maybe you\u2019re cynical about politics and think it doesn\u2019t really matter who is president. Maybe you don\u2019t want to vote for her because of the ongoing horrors in Gaza. Or maybe you wish that she didn\u2019t play footsie with frackers and was a fiercer advocate of the promise (and the inevitability) of the clean energy revolution.But we live in the world we have, not the world we wish for. And in this world, the job of making sure Donald Trump is not the next president of the United States could not be more urgent.\u00a0\n\nTRUMP THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE is a hoax. He makes jokes about sea-level rise creating more oceanfront real estate and how wind turbines kill birds and whales.\n\nTrump is running a pro-climate chaos campaign. To him, a superheated planet is a feature, not a bug. Think about this way: The more chaotic our world becomes, the easier it is for him to stoke fear, build walls, deploy the military, and cosplay the Strong Man.\u00a0\n\nHarris\u2019s record on climate is strong. She has called climate change \u201can existential threat.\u201d As California attorney general, she prosecuted oil companies for environmental violations.\n\n\u201cThe science is clear,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cExtreme weather will only get worse, and the climate crisis will only accelerate.\u2019\u2019\u00a0\n\nA vote for Kamala Harris ... is a vote to save ourselves.",

                "Content": "Open Letter to Potential Supporters of Jill Stein or Cornel West\n  \nDear friends of the environment,\n  \nOn behalf of the climate and our environment, \n  \nwe are asking you to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket as it represents our best chance at making more progress over the next four years.\n  \nAs we watch the destruction and tragedy unfold after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, there is only one candidate in the presidential election who has a track record of addressing climate change: Vice President Kamala Harris.\n  \nHarris is a climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the frontlines of needed progress and change. She\u2019s been a driving force in delivering the strongest climate action in history, and she\u2019s ready to build on those gains from day one as president.\n  \nTwo years ago this summer, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote that secured U.S. Senate passage\nof the strongest climate action in history \u2013 climate and clean energy incentives worth at least $370 billion over 10 years in the Inflation Reduction Act. She has also been a driving force to ensure that the solutions are equitable and address the unfair pollution and health burdens that our nation\u2019s front-line communities have suffered.\n  \nHarris has worked for environmental justice for two decades, starting after she was elected district attorney for San Francisco and, later, attorney general for California. She created one of the first environmental justice units in San Francisco and held oil companies and automakers accountable for their pollution.\n  \nFormer President Trump, on the other hand, waged the worst White House attack ever against\nthe environment and public health while in office. And he has made clear that his second term will be even more extreme, drawing from the detailed anti-environment proposals and plans contained in Project 2025. Every vote for Dr. Jill Stein or Cornel West instead of Kamala Harris makes it more likely that Donald Trump will win.\n  \nWe share your commitment to a safe and healthy environment for all and thank Stein and West\nfor raising important issues in this election, but Vice President Harris is the only candidate with a\nrecord of success addressing climate change. Please join us in voting for the Harris-Walz ticket and against the Trump-Vance pro-polluter ticket.\n  \nSincerely,  \n350 Action  \nCenter for Biological Diversity Action Fund  \nClimate Emergency Advocates  \nEarthjustice Action  \nFood and Water Action  \nFriends of the Earth Action  \nLeague of Conservation Voters  \nNRDC Action Fund  \nSierra Club  \nSunrise Movement",

                "Content": "In Arizona we have an extremely pivotal race that\u2019s going to determine whether we hit net zero or don\u2019t. Our public utility board is elected, the majority of the board are up for reelection in 2024 (3/5 members). It currently has a republican majority (4/5) who voted to gut energy efficiency rules, eliminate our renewable energy standard, and raise prices for consumers on rooftop solar.\u00a0\n\nWe have three candidates, if elected, who would reverse the trend, foster more renewable energy, phase out coal, and give ratepayers relief from rate increases. They have been campaigning hard, building connections across communities in our state, and stand a reasonable chance of getting elected. We need all three elected. If we just get one or two, there will be no climate change mitigation for Arizona.\u00a0\n\nAnd then we have the greens\u2026\u00a0\n\nThe Green Party, despite having a race with three open seats, fielded two candidates. Their campaigns have been absolutely non-serious. They have not had campaign events, they did not provide candidate statements through Arizona Clean Elections mailers, they did not provide cover photos, they did not set up a website. What they did do is set up a Facebook page one month before the election. The content mentions climate change as an important issue, then talks about Gaza and Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine, issues that resonate with progressives, but have nothing to do with public utility regulation.\u00a0\n\nMy fear is that all the get out the vote efforts will lead to more green votes, causing republicans to get the plurality and win the election. People will see a Facebook post with nice statements, and vote for a choice designed to redirect them from supporting serious candidates who will make meaningful contributions if elected.\u00a0\n\nDo not vote green. No politician ever acted the way you wanted because you made a protest vote. A vote for green is a vote for big oil, fracking, and indefinite coal use. They are an absolute mess, run completely non-serious campaigns designed to tip elections in favor of fossil fuel candidates, and a complete disaster for climate.\u00a0",

I'm still riding despite a few days of snow we had recently. That snow is all gone already! I'm sure we're going to get some more sloppy weather in January and February but if that's it then that's not too bad. 2 months out of the year certainly beats the 6 or 7 I'm accustomed to in terms of riding weather and conditions.\n\nWhen I was a young lad, snowstorms started in October and the snow hills were so big I'd dig tunnels in them and make snow forts. I've never seen my kids do this. The tunnels we made were so big sometimes a full grown adult could stand in them. It boggles my mind that people think global warming is a myth.

                "Content": "In 2016, Jill Stein helped Donald Trump win the election. She won 132,000 votes in the decisive swing states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania \u2014 while Trump\u2019s margin of victory was just 77,000 votes in those same states. \n  \nWhen confronted about being a spoiler for Trump, [Stein remained unapologetic](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/20/jill-stein-green-party-no-regrets-2016-215281) and said she doesn\u2019t have second thoughts. She has said it\u2019s a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d to be blamed for Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and considers it a \u201c[great honor](https://youtu.be/xbjq0I98Hd8)\u201d to be compared to Ralph Nader and his spoiler campaign. Her campaign surrogates admit she has [no path to victory](https://x.com/keithedwards/status/1843301144577405311) and that their top priority is [stopping Kamala Harris](https://x.com/keithedwards/status/1844109702764036515).\n  \nReporting from The Wall Street Journal and [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/09/23/jill-stein-paid-100000-to-a-consulting-firm-led-by-a-suspected-january-6-rioter/) revealed how the Stein campaign used a Republican consulting firm to help her get on the ballot, and in a recent court case in Nevada, Stein was represented by Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Jay Sekulow. \n  \nStein has had [troubling ties to Vladimir Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696) and her spoiler campaign benefitted from a Russian disinformation campaign in 2016. A [Senate Intelligence Committee](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html) report found that Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein. Additionally, the [Mueller Report](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/30/politics/jill-stein-russia-documents-senate-request/index.html) found that the Kremlin\u2019s Internet Research Agency used social media, including paid Facebook ads, to promote Stein\u2019s candidacy.

I also sucked it up and voted for Clinton in 2016. But this impulse to just blame everyone and anyone for the failures of the Democratic Party and HRC is truly maddening. HRC ran one of the worst GenElection campaigns I have ever seen. She came out of a deeply contentious primary with a Policy wonk to her Left; stopped talking substantive policy the moment he dropped out; did absolutely nothing herself to try to consolidate her own base, taking the stance of \"ehh, where else they gonna go?\"; and then spent the VAST majority of the following 3 months courting \"Moderate Republican\" Donors. As she sprinted right as fast as she could the moment Sanders was no longer forcing her left. Then the Dems learned absolutely nothing from it; blaming everything and anything else but themselves for the loss.\n\nThe Dems are a Center Right/Moderate Right Corporate party on everything but a handful of cheap to take stances on Left Leaning ID politics they're never the leaders on. They are certainly better than the alternative, but that bar is so insanely low it is not an accomplishment. On top of this, a Centrist Party beholden to the same donors as the Right Wing Party, only really exist to give more political power to their opposition by-design. By throwing most of their bargaining power away at the door, before the bargaining even begins. While this doctrine of \"Practical Incrementalism\" they preach just falls apart the moment one realizes that the other side have never been Incrementalists. Explaining the consistent, incremental march further to the right for decades on most topics on the Overton Window. To the point \"Feeding School Kids\", \"Climate Change is real\", and \"Codifying Womens rights the nation has gone 50 years backwards on\" is \"Progressive\"?\n\nSo ... Stein sucks.  But screw the Dems for sitting in their comfort space of apparent Dick Cheney levels of Right Wing war criminals now. I'll begrudgingly vote Harris, but I'm not going to sit here and get culty and defensive over a party that absolutely shares accountability for both Trump's successes AND fostering an environment in which \"Trumps\" could thrive. In a two party state, BOTH parties hold accountability for failure of state; while struggling so much to beat Trump of all people only reflects the Dem's weakness.  Plus, I'd guess most voters voting Stein would never have voted Clinton/Harris. They'd probably have stayed home. Lets stop pretending \"those Green votes where the Dem's property\" to avoid holding the Dems accountable for their own failures.  Due to their lack of vision, to tow their own deeply conservative donor lines.",

                "Content": "And rather ironically, a cooling of the North Atlantic would actually result in substantially hotter and drier summers in Western Europe. Various studies demonstrate this so-called cold-ocean-warm-summer feedback, with the more recent Oltmanns, Holliday et al. (2024) study warning that a severely hot and dry summer is imminent in northern and western Europe based on current subpolar SST cooling anomalies. Bischof, Kedzierski et al. (2023) also demonstrated the link between a strong cooling of the North Atlantic and the hot and dry summer of 2018 in the UK, with Rousi, Kornhuber et al. demonstrating the link between cold subpolar SSTs and atmospheric anomalies over northwestern Europe. Similarly, Whan, Zscheischler et al. demonstrate a strong correlation between soil moisture deficits and greater heat anomalies across Europe. Maritime Europe is particularly susceptible to changes in rainfall accumulation and this often results in more intense heatwaves and drought concerns, which create a self-perpetuating feedback based on these metrics. Observations by Schenk, V\u00e4liranta et al. (2018) and Bromley, Putnam et al. (2018) both demonstrated that this higher seasonality response occured during the Younger Dryas event, with Bromley's team demonstrating the warmer summer response in Scotland specifically. Considering that this warmer summer feedback was observable under glacial maximum conditions, it would be fair to assume that a substantial bias for warming would occur should it happen under current conditions.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the severe cooling feedback hypothesis is very out of date. It's based on an idealized preindustrial 1750 baseline of <300ppm and assume a very linear assumption of the hypothetical atmospheric response to changes in thermohaline circulation.  Subsequent atmospheric dynamics are severely underestimated by the current model methodology, with Rahmstorf et al. (2015) discussing this discrepancy in relation to CMIP outputs. Observations by Vautard, Cattiaux et al. demonstrated that warming rates in Western Europe have been disproportionate when compared to computer reconstructions, due to said models not accounting for atmospheric feedbacks. Proxy-based assumptions don't account for factors such as the substantially different conditions of the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interglacial to Younger Dryas reversal analog; the B/A interglacial already saw substantial continental glaciers in Northern Europe and North America - the Fennoscandinavian and Laurentide respectively - and a considerably lower atmospheric carbon volume, which sat around 190-200ppm. These conditions almost certainly exacerbated the cooling response to hypothetical AMOC collapse of that era. But needless to say, these conditions don't apply to the Anthropocene. For all intents and purposes, ~300ppm was the stable threshold for Arctic cryospheric stability, as we hadn't breached 300ppm for 800,000 years prior to industrialization. It was within this period that the Arctic achieved stable year-round glaciation.\n\nAt >420ppm, we're broadly analogous to the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period. Anthropocene albedo forcing continues to crash from its already fatally low levels, with the Arctic region entering a stage where it can no longer advect surplus heat efficiently. Factors such as darkening ice are already initiating an accelerative feedback and Arctic marine heatwave anomalies are being sustained by greenhouse gas forcing. Present atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are more conductive to trapping more heat and we're currently seeing carbon levels rise at an unprecedented rate, up to ten times faster than the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which is considered a potential analog for our near future climate. Atmospheric methane volumes suggest that we've been analogous to an ice age termination event for almost 20 years already, and a hypothetical AMOC collapse actually risks a substantial collapse of oceanic carbon sinks and potentially risks carbon outgassing.

His own words illustrate why it was going to be difficult.\n\n*As for why so many people still resist what the facts clearly show, I think, in part, the reason is that the truth about the climate crisis is an inconvenient one that means* ***we are going to have to change the way we live our lives.***\n\nWhat's happened since 2006?  Cars have gotten bigger, and we're buying more of the larger vehicles and driving them more miles.  Air travel has increased, from 2 billion passengers in 2006 to almost 5 billion now.  Cruise ships have increased, with the industry building bigger and bigger ships to keep up with demand, and they still can't build them fast enough.  Houses got bigger, requiring more energy to heat/cool them.  Our consumption of meat increased.  We shop more than we used to, buying more and more useless stuff -- things like fast fashion, which have been around since at least the 1990s, has exploded over the last 10-15 years.\n\nAnything you can think of that constituted our way of life in 2006 has been cranked up to 11.\n\nAnd then add in new stuff, like the explosive growth of the internet, which was tame in 2006 compared to now -- streaming, social media, gaming, AI.  \n\nA year after the book was published, the first iPhone was released, which kicked off an arms race of people constantly upgrading their smartphones, whether or not there was a need to do so.\n\nI could go on, but really -- why?\n\nA lot of people will point the finger at capitalism, that catch-all term that collectively describes the sellers, but everyone who can afford to do so is eagerly buying every single thing capitalism has to offer.",

But a law passed during the first Trump administration required the federal government to hold two lease sales there for fossil fuel drilling. The first was in 2021 and was ultimately suspended and canceled by the Interior Department because of the lack of interest from the oil industry.\n\nThe Trump-era law required the second lease sale to be held before the end of 2024. The Biden administration signaled Wednesday it plans to move forward with a 400,000-acre auction \u2014 the lowest acreage it could legally offer.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the many ways the White House and administration are trying to protect some of Biden\u2019s biggest accomplishments while president, including his vast portfolio of action on climate change and the environment.\u201d",

I find it utterly infuriating when moderate Democrats think that they need to pay lip service to a toxic destructive climate monster of an industry to win Pennsylvania. I don\u2019t actually think that is true, because studies have shown that 70 percent of Pennsylvania residents want fracking either banned or much more tightly regulated.\n\nBut I don\u2019t need to be in love. I need to be able to vote strategically.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people showed up to protect this place and to hold moderate Democrats accountable, and that was the key to victory here.\n\n*You know who didn\u2019t show up for this place? Jill Stein. She doesn\u2019t show up for these frontline battles.

For Stein to ignore all this and still attempt to call herself an activist is beyond hypocrisy, it is political malpractice. Shame on you, Dr. Stein! Shame on you for profiting from fracking and oil drilling.*\n\nI\u2019m not in love with Kamala Harris\u2019s positions\u2014on fracking, and on some other issues. But I will tell you what I am in love with. I\u2019m in love with our movements.\n\nI\u2019m in love with what we can do. The entire history of progressive progress in this country is of movements pushing moderate presidents. It happened with FDR and the labor movement. It happened with LBJ and the MLK and the civil rights movement. It happened with Obama and Biden and the movement for gay marriage. We organize and push them\u2014and that\u2019s how we get what we want. That\u2019s our progressive history in America.\n\nBut in order for us progressives to do our jobs and fight effectively for a more just and equitable world as a movement, we need to have Harris in office. If we have Donald Trump in office, there\u2019s no chance in hell that we\u2019re actually going to advance an environmental agenda.\n\nSo I urge you to please believe in us as a movement. Love us. Believe in our power. We have done this before\u2014and we can do it again with a moderate Democrat in office. Which is the only choice we\u2019ve got right now.\n\nIf everyone in who voted for Stein in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan had voted for the Democrat instead, Trump would never have been the president.\n\nWe have the true power. It comes from the bottom up.\n\nAnd I believe in us.\n\nA vote for Harris is a vote for us, a vote for our movements to have a fighting chance for change. Progressive politics and advancing our agenda in this country is not something that happens every four years when you vote, or every four years when a toxic egomaniac like Stein (or Trump, for that matter) runs for president. It is a daily commitment. So vote for Kamala Harris. Join the movement\u2014and I\u2019ll see you on the front lines.\"",

But first, a little history\u2026\n\nNot long ago the entire upper Delaware River basin in Pennsylvania\u2014one of the most beautiful areas in the country, in the watershed for New York City, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia\u2014was on the chopping block for fracking.\n\nA 75 mile stretch of the Delaware River could have become a toxic oil field. Fracking is an environmental apocalypse: millions of gallons of toxic fracking fluids, radioactive waste, underground water contamination, hundreds of thousands of truck trips, air pollution, land scarring, massive public health crises, and depleted water supply. Everything about the practice is toxic; it is inherently contaminating in the long and short term.\n\nOur community was quick to understand the threat and organize and mobilize against it. Every little town along the Delaware across New York and Pennsylvania had a mom-and-pop anti-fracking group spring up. My film Gasland, on HBO, was part of this campaign, and our Gasland tours went from town to town, Johnny Appleseed\u2013style, fostering our new movement.\n\nAmazingly, we won. We banned fracking in the Delaware River basin and in New York State, saving the water supply for 16 million people. One of the greatest achievements of the environmental movement in this century.\n\nWe did this by convincing the Democratic governors of New York and Delaware and the president at the time\u2014Barack Obama\u2014to ban fracking here. These were all moderate Democrats. Not exactly Bernie Sanders, if you know what I mean.\n\nRepublicans would have just said no. This whole place would have been completely fracked to hell. We would have lost. And the whole gorgeous, life-giving national treasure of the Delaware River would have been a toxic fracking zone.\n\nOur victory against fracking kept more carbon and methane in the ground than almost any other single environmental win in history\u2014making it a huge win for the climate as well.\"",

I rant all the time posting videos on my Facebook putting things into context for people now, bringing in big picture thinking and how we've normalized things and how without the work of those of the past we wouldn't have what we have now.

About how we're living in a vast billions of years old universe, and are sandwiched in-between billions of years worth of time ... So what do I care what people think of me and how they feel about how outspoken I'm becoming? Look at all the problems that exist. Do people think things are just gonna \"pan out\"? They think they lead unfulfilling lives now well just wait. All the movies and music and restaurants and concerts and get togethers in the world aren't gonna be able to take them out of their heads knowing that everything is falling apart and isn't right.

Higher prices discourages purchase of less efficient vehicles and equipment, and discourages use of said equipment.

                "Content": ">Another fact that makes Helene\u2019s devastation so unprecedented is that almost none of those hundreds of billions of dollars in losses will be paid out by insurance. While the storm caused most of its damage through flooding, which is covered under a government-run flood insurance program, very few residents of the southern Appalachian mountains hold flood policies \u2014 even those who live in federally designated flood zones. As of now, these storm victims in North Carolina and Tennessee have no guarantee of comprehensive public or private assistance as they try to piece their lives back together. \n\nDomestic climate refugees.\n\nIf they weren't insured or were underinsured, insurance won't cover it. The small towns don't have the resources to rebuild. I doubt that states would pour a significant percentage of their GDP into rebuilding, nor would the federal government. And even if the latter two did, how many times could they do it?\n\nCan they stay in the ruins of their towns and eke out a marginal life? Will they move? Where to? Into what housing? What jobs will they find?\n\nDroughts, heat waves, storms, hurricanes, floods, rising sea levels... the \"FO\" phase of climate change is here, and we're not ready for it.",

The big recent push for this started around the time of Sir Francis Bacon and Descartes, the former of whom vivisected animals because they \u2018didn\u2019t really feel pain anyways and their screaming was just an instinctual reaction\u2019.  It laid the seed for this disconnect with the world around us, really as an attempt to justify acquisition.  There\u2019s a reason the First Nations people of North America thought that Europeans suffered from a mental illness and didn\u2019t grasp the concept fully of owning land, because those Westerners didn\u2019t have a respect for nature.\n\nThere are lots of detailed reports on this, this idea what we need to grow perpetually is a capitalist concept, in fact it\u2019s the core imperative of capitalism.  There are many books on the subject, I highly recommend Jason Hickel\u2019s work, Less is More and The Divide are both great deep dives into this.  It\u2019s great that there is a paper that *theorizes* something unprovable, but what I\u2019m suggesting is analytical and objective history.",
