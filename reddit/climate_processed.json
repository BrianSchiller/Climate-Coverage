The people with power and money now make their money from the existing energy system and infrastructure i.e. fossil fuels. It's a gigantically profitable industry and they have massive reserves that they want to turn into trillions of dollars.\n\nThey have no interest in transitioning which is why they have no plans to. \n\nIf you think they are thinking about the long term, their track record and their current plans show that you are disastrously mistaken.\n\n> At some point, America said goodbye to the Pony Express - and we'll do it again with burning our concentrated fossil fuels where it no longer makes sense.\n\nIf left to the market, it will be 30-50 years too late to save a habitable planet. We are at 1.5C now with 2C+ about a decade away. We are way past the time where we can do anything other than dramatically reduce emissions by all means available.\n\n> We may need to keep those in store for a future when/if the world desperately needs them.\n\nSorry, do you follow this sub at all? You think the solution to some future energy shortage will be burning a ton of fossil fuels? If we want a functioning food system in a couple of decades, we have to shut this industry ASAP. I\n\n> Environmental regulations bring new businesses, new jobs, safer communities, and cascading benefits.\n\nIndeed they do. But they impose costs on existing businesses. And it's the existing businesses that are buying the politicians.\n\nCorporations are in it for profits. They aren't enlightened planners of our society. That is what we are supposed to have democratic governments for. Unfortunately, our governments are now owned and run in the interests of capitalist oligarchs, not us.\n\n> Part of it is simply education - and accurate economic news reporting. \n\nThe industries most resisting the transition are the ones who knew most about it first. It's not about education. It's about power and the self interest of capitalist corporations.\n\n> The world is about to change drastically. America deserves a good seat at the table.\n\nAmerica is the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases. It is the home of the biggest fossil fuel industry in the world. It is the headquarters of the global climate denial system and it has wrought terrible destruction around the world in search of profits for its corporations, the fossil fuel industry being probably the most egregious, destructive and damaging. Even now, the US occupies a third of Syria so ConocoPhillips and Occidental can extract Syria's oil.\n\nI think the US *deserves* to pay trillions in reparations to the rest of the world and to ramp down its emissions to zero over the next 15 years.",

Under Biden, and with his help, that industry has **significantly** expanded to the point that it is producing planet-boiling fossil fuels faster than at any time in history.\n\nThat makes Biden bad on climate. Not just imperfect. \"Imperfect\" would be failing to reduce emissions in line with the Paris targets (which obviously he hasn't done either). Biden has actively made the situation worse by expanding the fossil fuel industry at a time when it has to be managed down. \n\nNot because I want that. Not because it's a good political ploy. Not because progressives would see that as a win. Not even because I hate the psychopaths who run the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIt has to be managed down right now because the atmospheric physics dictates that if it isn't, we will pass irreversible tipping points in the climate system and we will rapidly lose a habitable climate. There are no marks for effort or good intentions here.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Trump could probably find ways to be worse. But be under no illusion. Biden has been net bad for the climate.",

                "Content": "> No, because the real issue is whether the fossil fuels industry has a future or not. The real killing blow to the fossil fuels industry is going to be an adequate alternative that is economically viable. By expanding the wind, solar, EV and similar industries, you're preparing for the long term decline in fossil fuels.\n\nWhat \"long term\"?! We have to cut global emissions at insane rates now thanks to 4 more wasted years. 1.5C is now completely out the window and in the rear view mirror. We need emissions cuts in the region of 8-10% per year to hit 2C now.\n\nAnd growth in renewables does not guarantee the death of the fossil fuel industry. Under capitalism, the GDP has to grow at least 3% per year to keep the system stable. Which means the GDP will literally double by 2050. And energy use is effectively pegged to GDP. It's an extremely tightly correlated relationship for robust structural reasons.\n\nWhich means that renewables growth can be huge and it still doesn't end fossil fuels - renewables just add to them. Which is precisely what we are seeing now. \n\n> However, yes the US oil production is insanely high, but you've got to consider the massive increase in oil prices during Bidens term, along with the spike in LNG demand which has increased exports and thus the demand for fracked gas (which Biden is also trying to limit by stopping the permitting of new LNG terminals).\n\nThe reason production went up was because of government policy both under Trump and Biden. \n\nTemporarily high prices, and this is well documented, were due to some producers temporarily holding back production after the pandemic because it was a way to spike prices as demand returned to the economy, and this generates spectacular profits in the short term. Giving the greenlight to MVP or Willow Project or Line 3 etc etc etc has zero impact on that situation.\n\nAnd if the response to every energy shortage is \"quick - build more fossil fuel infrastructure!\" then hopefully you can see that we are definitely totally dead.\n\nThere were other options available when Europe (primarily Germany) suddenly needed to replace the gas supply from Germany. Remember when Ukraine and the US blew up Nordstream, Germany actually had to spend billions of euros to expand its LNG import facilities. It took time. It is investing at least 10 billion euros more on larger, permanent facilities. It didnt have to do this. It could have invested in clean forms of energy and energy storage. But instead it turned to expensive, very dirty LNG from the USA to plug the gap. How convenient.\n\nRemember, we are in a climate emergency NOW. It's not in the future. It is already having catastrophic effects including in Germany. Building fossil fuel infrastructure now is like pouring petrol on the fire which is consuming your home. Germany had alternatives. It chose US LNG.\n\n> So while the trend has been upwards it is only a temporary increase due to the geopolitical situation. Overall, the trend is towards a greener future.\n\nNo, it isn't. This is fantasy based on zero empirical evidence. The fossil fuel industry is rapidly expanding across the world. It has long term plans for even more expansion.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\n\nThis article is now out of date. There are several new projects that weren't on this list from 2022.\n\n> Also, the US political system is screwed which has basically tied Bidens one hand, limiting his action on climate.\n\nNo, the US political system is working exactly as designed and Biden is playing his part.\n\nThe US is a capitalist oligarchic empire. Biden's job, and he has done this job better than most throughout his whole career, is to serve that oligarchy. And along with the banks and the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry is at the front of the queue when it comes to state support and collaboration. For gods sake, the US expended literally trillions of dollars on the war in Iraq specifically for the fossil fuel industry, and Biden was one of the biggest backers of the war in Congress - Democrat or Republican.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SemNT372CIw?si=l3OSsqOooobhH2F4\n\nI don't know who you think Biden is but I suspect you have the wrong idea.",

Sure, fire Three Mile Island up right now, provided there are no issues with the cooling water. I have to be as honest as I'm able, so that's a rock solid plus one for OP.\n\nCriticising renewable subsidies is churlish at best. On the other side, nuclear has negative externalities such as unremediated uranium mine sites & tailings dams, plus damage to groundwater as OP correctly points out. It's a weaker counterargument for sure, but analyses have demonstrated that solar PV and wind are the cheapest new build options by a significant margin, and notwithstanding that that margin is largely wiped out by the cost of transmission lines and batteries, panels and turbines continue to become cheaper and more efficient, while OP's SMRs remain firmly in the domain of superpower navies.\n\nOP has a valid criticism about land clearing for PV, but turbine bird deaths are and will conceivably be only a fraction of those from buildings. Sea life deaths from offshore turbines have not been demonstrated and could not conceivably occur outside of construction, with the exception of sea bird deaths which may be acceptably minimised by avoiding sensitive areas.\n\nI don't know why production subsidies to PV owners is in this list; it doesn't fit and if we're going to let voodoo economists into the room then we should have them analyse the opportunity costs of all that R & D money and fat government contracts fission has received for decades, not forgetting to account for subsidies renewable research has also received, of course.\n\nLithium mining as it currently exists is problematic, as OP correctly points out, but not inherently so: we have lithium mines here in Western Australia and while they're not as \"efficient\" in economic terms they're certainly acceptably clean.\n\nI won't speak to the situation in the USA, but new nuclear as it stands here in Australia is a non starter, for all the above reasons plus the mind wittering expense, complexities, cost of labour (train the corps of nuclear engineers, plus the opportunity cost of them not doing something else), regulatory hurdles (we gotta write laws from scratch) and the nimbyism which applies to just about anything but -rightly or wrongly- is particularly acute for reactors.\n\nYet our opposition leader ~~Lord Voldemort~~ Peter Dutton has a ~~lanthanide~~ *actinide* reinforced, PPP plated chubby for six, count them, reactors?? <Shakes head sadly>",

                "Content": ">let me know what you think\n\nI think the text does exactly what it accuses Fonda of, only in reverse. The main argument seems to revolve around portraying renewables as bad. First, the assertion that they wouldn't be able to provide power \"around the clock\" even with batteries, and then this paragraph with an full-out anti-renewable bashing:\n\n>Everywhere you look, there are value judgments. What\u2019s worse: leveling a Joshua tree forest to build a solar farm or offering rooftop solar incentives that drive up electric rates for everyone else?\n\nSeriously? How would leveling a forest be necessary, and why do incentives to put solar panels on rooftops instead have to drive up costs for everyone? Sounds quite disingeneous.\n\n>Should we put wind turbines on land, where they kill birds, or offshore, where they might harm marine life?\n\nWhy not apply siting rules that minimize those impacts, and how come there aren't any complaints about other high-rise buildings that kill birds, or the fishing industry that harms marine life? Off-shore wind farms even provides a [refuge for some marine life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S100107422300205X).\n\n>How about the fact that lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that store solar and wind power, can fuel environmentally destructive mining?\n\nBut when it is storing nuclear generated electicity in EVs it is somehow better?\n\n>In an argument reminiscent of right-wing talking points against renewable power,\n\nThat's not just reminiscent that paragraph literally repeats those talking points.\n\n>These are hard questions.\n\nNo these are not hard questions, they are bogus questions with false dichotomies. We should not clear non-cultivated land for solar farms, there is more than sufficient space on cultivated and built-on land to put solar panels on. Wind turbines should be properly sited with mechanisms to protect wild-life as much as possible. That isn't a reason for not expanding low-carbon power supply as quickly as possible to reduce fossil fuel burning.\n\n>I am here to ask everyone reading this: Do you have any opinions you\u2019d consider changing if it meant preserving a livable planet, for yourself and future generations?\n\nOf course, I am willing to change any of my opinions.\n\n>Any habits or lifestyle choices you\u2019d be willing to alter?\n\nYes, though I don't see how this is connected to the argument at hand.\n\nWe don't necessarily *need* solar, or wind, or nuclear, or hydro, or geothermal you could think up all kinds of different low-carbon systems from nuclear only to solar+batteries only. The question is what is the best strategy for a quick replacement of fossil fuel burning. And the answer to that almost certainly varies from region to region. It is the blatant denial of solutions like this: \"*What\u2019s more, solar panels and wind turbines can\u2019t power society 24/7.*\" that are not helpful in mapping out the space of possible solutions for the *hard* problem of climate change.",

Here's how it starts:\n\n>*Jane Fonda is a powerful, passionate climate advocate. She\u2019s\u00a0gotten arrested\u00a0protesting at the U.S. Capitol,\u00a0raised money\u00a0to defeat a Big Oil ballot measure in California and\u00a0written a book\u00a0about activism. She lives her values.*\n\n>*So I was disappointed by some of the anti-nuclear arguments Fonda made in a\u00a0recent opinion piece.*\n\n>*Writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fonda slammed a deal to\u00a0restart Pennsylvania\u2019s Three Mile Island nuclear plant, site of an infamous 1979 partial meltdown that destroyed one of the site\u2019s two reactors. The plant\u2019s owner has agreed to restart the functioning reactor \u2014 which shut down five years ago because it was losing money \u2014 now that tech giant Microsoft has agreed to buy the climate-friendly electricity to supply its data centers.*\n\n>*It\u2019s no surprise that Fonda isn\u2019t happy. She\u2019s fought nuclear power for decades, rallying against\u00a0California\u2019s Diablo Canyon plant\u00a0and starring in a 1979 film,\u00a0\u201cThe China Syndrome,\u201d\u00a0that warns of nuclear energy\u2019s dangers.*\n\n>*\u201cI understand the temptation to embrace nuclear,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe absolutely need to phase out oil, gas, and coal \u2014 the fossil fuels overheating our planet \u2014 and fast. Any means of achieving that goal deserves consideration.\u201d*\n\n>*Ultimately, though, Fonda doesn\u2019t seem interested in giving nuclear much consideration.*\n\nAgain, I hope you'll read the whole thing and let me know what you think.

totally clear world transitioning renewables seemed like inevitable never really sure know back people hydrogen like oh maybe going hydrogen car maybe battery electric really take blah blah blah anyway seems totally clear world transitioning renewables within timeframe like 20 50 year world 100 renewable thing currently live world something like billion people access power transitioning renewables still leave u world billion people access power editor note number people living without electricity today actually closer 760 million system change many people left behind honnold foundation try find sweet spot helping transition helping people left behind part necessity professional rock climber tech billionaire smallscale grant make sense extent also biggest impact human life smallscale project fundamentally way people live huge impact live la vega see huge solar farm around desert great grid going 100 renewable realistically difference make people life maybe small utility rate really people benefit utility shareholder warren buffettowned utility case nv energy really inspiring long rant say honnold foundation trying help human need get chance use solar panel greenland expedition trip running generator production charging like 50 battery funny expedition antarctica made little climbing film well trip planned take generator somebody forgot fuel got like oh wound whole trip solar totally worked first expedition since becoming father worked cause long time curious perspective changed since daughter june joined family know another daughter way yeah soon think perspective changed much always cared kind issue bigger way spend time family force little bit tighter choice making expedition choose go make trip like even worthwhile get great climbing real purpose behind get share important knowledge thing matter tell little decision bring he\u00efdi board heard version story earlier week curious found roped amazing delightful thing he\u00efdi spend time make care ice even like ice thing like rock made much knowledgeable much caring type world consider optimist come think weird optimistic despite data contrary understand prediction much gain far 20 year reading environmental nonfiction really chosen make anything opportunity still incredible opportunity build better world live cleaner world still choose point keep thinking point going choose keep ignoring obvious thing forever get involved arctic ascent expedition absolute dream come true felt extremely lucky get call team extremely challenging go one remote location one least studied place earth alex know firm believer scientific work planet really aligned took year prior expedition design work could boot ground wanted know like put together scientific objective expedition like little bit unconventional film crew climbing involved think extremely brave extremely daring entire team willingness invite scientist board best climber world climbing challenging hostile environment also filming series documentary best possible science easy took step step contacted university lab institution interested data part world also interested training collect data really felt thinking whole time really felt like astronaut i one best possible work ended 16 different protocol expedition really major know worked nasa worked research institute denmark university buffalo university kansa example challenging dream come true trusted scientist first big polar expedition actually greenland back 2011 back island research trip one spent tiny bit time far field east greenland around coastline mostly science communication people wanted learn impact greenland ice sheet big research expedition greenland since 2011 change absolutely massive going question arctic one fastestwarming place earth everything taking place greenland impacting rest world felt duty mission top climbing incredible monolith actually bring something back society series talk remote understudied east greenland scientist expedition assisted support helicopter boat expedition like one happening time issue funding lack scientific interest particular region crazy think little data ground east greenland satellite many satellite want tricky get understand place 10 month year sea ice blocking access field ten month year rest year yes access plane access boat expensive great project mind lower carbon footprint example worked fisherman boat nearby village entrance field important u use local mean transportation course use helicopter every way remote expensive top everything extremely hostile oh gosh bashing get go something really wanted show series powerful nature accelerating making change even violent think important show nature start bit destabilized get angry paper nature came earlier month said nearly every glacier greenland thinned retreated past decade series bit good news daugaardjensen glacier little bit stable anticipating insight might great keep part mystery like still totally understand taking place scientist working told u bit technical shape bedrock seems glacier resting little ridge might holding everything together might reason glacier still stable also part greenland still receives lot snow seen crack perfect picture know nasa float launched expedition told u temperature water fjord increasing perfect environment around definitely changing seems advantage finding expedition particularly excited science take long time moment still waiting lot result different protocol want share something simple greenland hold lot ice lose ice mean 6 7 meter sealevel rise saw paper published nature moment greenland losing 30 million ton ice per hour crucial understand every action conduct back home reduce carbon footprint preserve help greenland help collective future data help u prepare thing come last question taken rock climbing honest think bit traumatized good way think needed minute recover really want start climbing launch series know mission year otherwise think alex hazel never forgive",

                "Content": ">\u00a0Effects could be varied and wide-ranging. In a 2009 experiment in the southwest Atlantic Ocean by German and Indian scientists, larger zooplankton ate the smaller phytoplankton\u2014and little carbon actually reached the deep sea. In an experiment that was conducted in 2006 in the northeastern Pacific by researchers in the U.S. and Canada, toxic phytoplankton species\u00a0flourished. This has raised fears that fertilization could create \u201cdead zones\u201d where rampant algal blooms would consume all the oxygen in the water, snuffing out other life. Phytoplankton blooms could also consume nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen that then wouldn\u2019t be available for organisms elsewhere, a phenomenon known as \u201cnutrient robbing.\u201d In addition, scientists still know little about the deep-ocean ecosystems where the carbon is supposed to be stored. \u201cMost likely [iron fertilization] will affect something that we don\u2019t really understand yet,\u201d says deep-sea expert Lisa Levin of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who is not involved in the ExOIS program. Last year a\u00a0computer modeling study\u00a0done by British, American and French researchers found that adding one million to two million metric tons of iron into the ocean each year could draw down 45 billion metric tons of carbon by 2100. It would also rob nutrients from other sea life, however. Along with an estimated 15 percent reduction in marine biomass caused by warming, another 5 percent could be lost because of iron fertilization, particularly in fishing areas near the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian coasts. \u201cI haven\u2019t really seen [ExOIS] present a hypothesis of what\u2019s wrong with previous work ... that either makes the carbon yield higher or minimizes the negative consequences,\u201d says Alessandro Tagliabue of the University of Liverpool in England, co-lead author of that study.",

Not existing is not a negative thing, it's not even neutral, because it's not on the spectrum of virtue; it can't be. It's only because we exist that we can even conceive of not existing. \n\nObviously not all of life is bad, and I'm sure that for some, potentially even most, people, life is 'worth it,' but there's absolutely no way to guarantee that this will be the case for your children. Perhaps this is a risk that someone is willing to take, but the choice to take this inherent risk is non-consensual. In that sense, it is always at least a little selfish. Because, again, the person who is to become your child is not capable of missing out on any experience whilst they don't exist.",

And DAC is a high energy consumption pipe dream, which only works when you have super abundant and clean energy - a handful of places in the world (like geothermal facilities) work for this, there is absolutely nothing special about a datacenter which suggests it would do better than any random air for DAC, and the energy in use there is generally very high emission and not worthwhile when trading generation emissions versus the capture from DAC.\n\nThey used AI to guess at what kind of structures might act as super-sorbents?

                "Content": "new ending: \n\n# Part 3: A New Paradigm of Rapid Regeneration and Growing Energy Demand\n\nThe Net Zero activists and Ted Kaczinsky fail to see that a rapid rise of AI has transformed global energy dynamics, creating unprecedented opportunities to rethink energy production. With AI energy demand projected to grow exponentially, what might initially seem like a burden becomes an opportunity to scale sustainable, renewable energy infrastructure. Unlike previous eras of industrial expansion that heavily relied on fossil fuels, this moment offers the chance to align energy growth with ecological restoration.\n\n# 1. AI-Driven Energy Innovation:\n\nAI itself can be a key driver of energy efficiency and sustainability. From optimizing solar panel placements to enhancing grid management with predictive algorithms, AI technologies are enabling faster deployment of renewables. The sheer demand for energy to power AI systems\u2014akin to a modern industrial revolution\u2014is spurring investment in scalable solutions like solar farms, wind power, and advanced battery storage. This demand-driven growth creates economies of scale, making clean energy cheaper and more accessible.\n\n# 2. Ecological Restoration as a Balancing Act:\n\nWhile energy expansion is necessary to meet AI-driven growth, it must be paired with ecological restoration to offset environmental impacts. Technologies like reforestation drones, bioengineered carbon sinks, and AI-assisted land rehabilitation can restore habitats and capture carbon emissions. For example, regions undergoing renewable energy infrastructure development can simultaneously implement restoration projects, such as wetland reconstruction or rewilding efforts, ensuring that energy growth contributes to ecological health rather than harm.\n\n# 3. Energy for Restoration:\n\nAI-driven energy innovation doesn\u2019t just meet human needs\u2014it can also directly fuel ecological restoration. Clean energy sources can power desalination plants for reforesting arid regions, support biotechnological breakthroughs in soil regeneration, and sustain large-scale carbon removal projects. The synergy between energy abundance and restoration efforts creates a virtuous cycle: energy expansion supports ecological repair, and healthy ecosystems enhance climate resilience.\n\n# 4. A Future of Abundance and Balance:\n\nThis new paradigm doesn\u2019t ask humanity to shrink its ambitions or retreat from progress. Instead, it invites us to grow intelligently\u2014leveraging technological innovation to harmonize energy needs with environmental stewardship. AI\u2019s rising energy demand can become the catalyst for a new era of sustainable abundance, where human advancement and ecological health are no longer at odds. By meeting energy challenges head-on while actively restoring the planet, we can turn a potential crisis into a transformative opportunity.\n\nThis paradigm aligns human progress with ecological health, embracing technology as a tool for both growth and restoration. Unlike Kaczynski\u2019s vision of dismantling industrial society or the sustainability movement\u2019s calls for restraint, rapid regeneration and energy abundance offer a hopeful middle path.",

I learned about over population and global warming in school, they told us about the extinction of cute animals and all the suffering. Then I found out the neighbour kid was adopted and what that meant, so the plan came together perfectly. \n\nSeemed VERY clear to me that there were more than enough people and if I ever got the urge to raise children, I\u2019d adopt, foster, or volunteer. I told my parents immediately and they thought I\u2019d grow out of it, like everything else I never grew out of (i.e. vegetarianism). \n\n30 years later - I\u2019m a childless scientist working to protect the environment and couldn\u2019t be happier with that decision. I don\u2019t have time for kids with my busy career anyway. I\u2019m working to protect the environment for the sake of the innocent creatures on this planet, not humans. The Earth is beautiful and humans are no more important than any living creature on this planet. I don\u2019t hate humans, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re above pandas or elephants or anything else. I think we have forfeited our turn on this planet by killing and destroying so much of it.

But the number of coal plants is also growing. \n\nIt also says we have 65% of the technology we need for the predictions.

They assume technology that doesn't exist yet is going to be a fact.\n\nThey also talk about sodium batteries as if they have no constraints themselves. That was amusing. \n\nI found something interesting though. Simon Michaux's report is based on the IEA predictions and he basically crunched the numbers.

As expected, the US leads the world in cumulative emissions (118 million tons, compared to 74 million for China), while China is currently emitting the most CO2 per year (12 million tons, vs. 5 million tons for the US).\n\nHowever, this fails to account for the fact that a large portion of America's resource extraction and manufacturing has been exported to countries like China and India over the past 30 years, to the tune of over [$3 trillion per year](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions). Accounting for emissions in a global economy is [very complex](https://archive.is/CcxqH) (and somewhat arbitrary), but all estimates show [China's emissions decreasing](https://ourworldindata.org/consumption-based-co2) (and US emissions increasing) when we do.

                "Content": "> Not everyone agrees. Warming of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by 2050 is unlikely, said climate scientist\u00a0Michael Mann, director of the\u00a0Center for Science, Sustainability & the Media at the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\n> Mann said he doesn\u2019t think the findings in the draft paper will withstand peer review because the research doesn\u2019t adequately account for the cooling effects of cutting other short-lived climate-warming pollutants, which can offset the heating resulting from the reduction of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. Black soot, which absorbs heat from the sun, can warm the atmosphere in the short term, and other\u00a0extremely potent industrial pollutants\u00a0emitted in tiny quantities have an outsized climate heating effect.\n\n> Calculations of those different effects are included in the most recent\u00a0global climate assessments\u00a0by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that serve as the basis for global climate policy talks, he said.\u00a0\n\n> The IPCC reports show that the competing effects nearly cancel each other out, which would make 2 degrees Celsius warming by 2050 less likely. But those same IPCC projections include big cuts of methane emissions as another key to offsetting the spike in warming from the reduction of atmospheric sulfates. But methane emissions are not declining; they\u2019ve accelerated sharply the past five years\n\n[Link](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26052023/james-hansen-climate-change-2-degrees-2050/#:~:text=Hansen's%20previous%20warning%20about%20the,warm%20ocean%20and%20land%20surfaces.)\n\nI mean, a big heat spike has come with every El-Ni\u00f1o since 1998.

        "Content": "I feel like the window for climate change reversal is closed, and conversation should focus on adjusting to the changes rather than reversing them. \n\nI don't get to talk to anyone about this, so I think I am just trying to get my own thoughts out. I could be wrong, and I am open to changing my thoughts.\n\nFirst, the overall discussion of Milton is very doomsday-ish. Yes, it's a monster, but we will recover and we will adjust. Claiming Cat 5's will be the new normal is just the opposite side of the same coin of people thinking you can steer hurricanes. There is so much wrong with both, you don't even know where to start. I feel like climate change conversations are the same. The storm is here. We should talk about how to live with it - not how to undo it.\n\nNext, many of the trigger points have already reached critical moments that we are still hoping are reversible. Really, how in the world would we speed up global ocean currents - after 50+ years of slowing them down? And that is just 1 of the many large systems that are at this point - much less the dozens of smaller ones.\n\nThe Antarctic ice has been extremely, record-breaking low 2 years in a row! How many sub-systems stalled for that to happen? Do we even know of them all? Sure, the Antarctic waxes and wanes, but but never to this degree. Its done - that ice is never coming back to the same levels.\n\nAlso, the world's largest fossil fuel deposit was just discovered near those waters. There is a treaty keeping countries from drilling, but that expires in 20 years, so good luck keeping companies out of there. \n\nSpeaking of carbon dioxide, for some reason people tried to cling to the smokes and mirrors that Covid brought down carbon emissions AND the world started improving. Sorry, the record low ice levels where after Covid, the oceans currents continued to decline, and methane from the permafrost never stopped. Too many gears are turning too quickly at this point. \n\nIf I smoked for 70 years, and I got lung cancer, then reducing my smoking for 2 years isn't going to do anything. Too many systems have failed. It's done.\n\nThere is no putting methane back in the permafrost, so thats already a run-away system. This change is due to 50+ years of actions leading in that direction, so even slowing it down is not possible. \n\nI don't need to mention wars, war-tactics, and the local environments, because it's obvious. Plus, for those people in those regions, I cannot blame (you can't worry about scarring when you are on fire). However, I wonder how many Tesla need to replace gasoline vehicles to make up for a sinking tanker or destroyed oilfield? \n\nThen we have solar energy, which has been scammed onto most homes through companies, promising lower bills, cashing out government subsidies, sub-contracting 15 layers of sevices to the point you don't know who to contact if your battery dies - hopefully, before the company folds, renames itself, and pops back with a new, updated scam terms. However, this behavior is having a cultural effect - people are losing trust in the entire idea of switching to solar energy.\n\nRecycling is a joke that doesn't even need to be discussed at the moment. Between, Africa, China, and a few other countries, recycling just means, \"I want this trash really, really far away.\", and some companies charge you an extra $250 a quarter for it. Pass.\n\nI don't want to get too far into the weeds when it comes to people and understanding, but you have the so many who think we are pushing a 700-mile wide storm around, and others think that oceans are going to be 3-feet higher in 10 years. And that is just raw ignorance, not even monetarily motivated ignorance. Its not been until very recently that people have become accepting of nuclear energy. Until we see a global crisis in our face, then this is not going to change.\n\nI don't know. Sorry if this isn't the place for random thoughts, but I feel like we are too far gone. I feel like we are wasting time and money talking about sucking carbon dioxide out of the air, when conversation should start focusing how to adjust to how Earth is changing.\n\n",

Yeah, I am familiar with the place.\n\nSure, it has a HUGE thermal potential.   You're right.\n\nHOWEVER..... what we *know* about the thermal workings of the place is not zero.  But it is still akin to what we *know* about the surface of Alpha Centuari.... which is *close* to zero.

So let's do R&D on a smaller scale in other smaller areas, scattered throughout the west.  There are \"hot springs\" in most of the western states, from the coast east to the continental divide.

You even start your column with a quote from His Dark Materials, which contains vastly more creative ideas than that, all generated by a human.\n\nOne of the many things I dislike about AI is how those pushing it for their own profit persistently belittle human ability, creativity and ingenuity. It tells us that human beings could never produce the images like the ones above. But of course they could. They have (often that's what AI is harvesting for its own images).\n\nThe difference is that AI does it faster. But so what? Why is that important, especially when by speeding up that process we also rob humans of the chance to take the reins of that creativity (while guzzling an enormous amount of energy)?\n\nLastly, I challenge the fatalism of this phrase: \"But like it or not, AI is here to stay.\" I find that fatalism in itself part of the propaganda of AI; like saying \"Like it or not, Trump is here to stay\".\n\nIs it? Why? There are already various indications that the AI bubble is about to burst, like so many other useless, limited and destructive technologies before it that have similarly been shoved down our throats by Silicon Valley ego-monsters.\n\nLots of good critique of the supposed achievements of AI here:\n\n[https://www.wheresyoured.at/](https://www.wheresyoured.at/)",

                "Content": "Hi all, I hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think. Here's how it starts:\n\n>*\u201cTell them stories. They need the truth. You must tell them true stories, and everything will be well.\u201d*\n\n>*So says the ghost of an old woman to nun-turned-astrophysicist Mary Malone in \u201cThe Amber Spyglass,\u201d the final tome in Philip Pullman\u2019s \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d trilogy and one of my favorite novels. The admonition came to mind as I explored an unusual art exhibit at the USC\u2019s Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, two dozen miles off the Southern California coast.*\n\n>*A series of 11 images envisions a sustainable future for Los Angeles \u2014 as dreamed up by artificial intelligence.*\n\n>*One image shows a downtown streetscape, shaded by overhead walkways teeming with vegetation. Another adds solar panels to the hillsides beneath the Hollywood sign. Several contemplate vibrant futures for the L.A. River, tearing out\u00a0concrete flood-control straitjackets\u00a0along its banks and reviving the waterway with abundant plants and wildlife, as well as walking paths.*\n\n>*One especially mind-bending picture replaces cars with bicycles on a freeway along the river.*\n\n>*Are any of these visions realistic? Does it matter if they could ever be \u201ctrue\u201d?*\n\n>*And how should we feel about the fact that shadowy computer brains played a role in creating them?*\n\n>*I posed those questions to Allison Agsten, the art curator at USC\u2019s Wrigley Institute for Environment and Sustainability. She also leads the Center for Climate Journalism and Communication at USC\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and she oversaw development of the sustainable L.A. exhibit. She has mixed feelings about artificial intelligence herself.*\n\n>*\u201cThis installation represents an experiment,\u201d Agsten said.*\n\n>*And not always a smooth one, she was quick to acknowledge.*\n\n>*Catalina Island has been\u00a0plagued by invasive mule deer, which were introduced by humans in the 1930s for hunting. According to the Catalina Island Conservancy, the nonnative deer destroy natural habitats, increasing fire risk and harming native animals.*\n\n>*But when USC cinematic arts professor Kathy Smith and three grad students asked their AI programs, which\u00a0included\u00a0Midjourney and OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E, to dream up a sustainable Catalina, one of the programs created an image of \u201ca flourishing deer population,\u201d Agsten recalled \u2014 seemingly tricked by all the online discussion into thinking that more deer would be good, not terrible.*\n\n>*\u201cI said \\[to the students\\], let\u2019s talk about why that image isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Agsten told me.*\n\n>*The invasive mule deer didn\u2019t make the exhibit. Neither did various other digital fever dreams, from some that Agsten described as \u201cdark and apocalyptic\u201d to others that she called \u201csome of our absolutely most radical depictions\u201d of a future Los Angeles.*\n\n>*I know just enough about artificial intelligence to be worried \u2014 but not enough to know how worried I should be.*\n\n>*In the hands of Google and Meta, the technology\u00a0threatens the news business, by taking journalism produced by people like me and handing it out for free (after occasionally mangling it to the point where it\u2019s no longer accurate). The data centers that power AI consume\u00a0huge amounts of energy and water.\u00a0Also bad: Liars can use AI to create images that distort reality for nefarious ends, such as tricking people into thinking that national parks have been\u00a0overrun by migrant tent camps. (They have not.)*\n\n>*So why turn to potentially dystopian tech to envision a better future? Why not let Smith and her students flex their creativity?*\n\nAgain, I hope you'll read the whole piece and share you're thoughts!

Here's how it starts:\n\n>*In the early morning light, it\u2019s easy to mistake the towering gray mounds for an odd-looking mountain range \u2014 pale and dull and devoid of life, some pine trees and shrublands in the foreground with lazy blue skies extending up beyond the peaks.*\n\n>*But the mounds aren\u2019t mountains.*\n\n>*They\u2019re enormous piles of dirt, torn from the ground by crane-like machines called draglines to open paths to the rich coal seams beneath. And even though we\u2019re in rural southeastern Montana, more than 800 miles from the Pacific Ocean, West Coast cities are largely to blame for the destruction of this landscape.*\n\n>*Workers at the Rosebud Mine load coal onto a conveyor belt, which carries the planet-wrecking fuel to a power plant in the small town next door. Plant operators in Colstrip burn the coal to produce electricity, much of which is shipped by power line to homes and businesses in the Portland and Seattle areas. It\u2019s been that way for decades.*\n\n>*\u201cThe West Coast markets are what created this,\u201d Anne Hedges says, as we watch a dragline move dirt.*\n\n>*She sounds frustrated, and with good reason.*\n\n>*Hedges and her fellow Montana environmentalists were happy when Oregon and Washington passed laws requiring 100% clean energy in the next two decades. But they\u2019re furious that electric utilities in those states are planning to stick with coal for as long as the laws allow, and in some cases making deals to give away their Colstrip shares to co-owners who seem determined to keep the plant running long into the future.*\n\n>*\u201cCoal is not dead yet,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cIt\u2019s still alive and well.\u201d*\n\n>*That\u2019s an uncomfortable reality for West Coasters critical of red-state environmental policies but not in the habit of urging their politicians to work across state lines to change them \u2014 especially when doing so might involve compromise with Republicans.*\n\n>*One example: California lawmakers have*\u00a0[*refused to pass bills*](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2018/09/06/california-approves-100-climate-friendly-energy-punts-other-bills/1204451002/)\u00a0*that would make it easier to share clean electricity across the West, passing up the chance to spur renewable energy development in windy red states such as Montana and Wyoming \u2014 and to show them it\u2019s possible to create construction jobs and tax revenues with renewable energy, not just fossil fuels.*\n\n>*Instead, California has prioritized in-state wind and solar farms, bowing to the will of labor unions that want those jobs.*\n\n>*It\u2019s hard to blame Golden State politicians, and voters, for taking the easy path.*\n\n>*But global warming is a global problem \u2014 and whether we like it or not, the electric grid is a giant, interconnected machine. Coal plants in conservative states help fuel the ever-deadlier heat waves, fires and storms battering California and other progressive bastions. The electrons generated by those plants flow into a network of wires that keep the lights on across the American West.*\n\n>*Also important: Montana and other sparsely populated conservative states control two U.S. Senate seats each, and at least three electoral votes apiece in presidential elections. Additional federal support for clean energy rests partly in their hands.*\n\n>*Those are the practical considerations. Then there are the ethical ones.*\n\nAgain \u2014 that's just the beginning. Really hope you'll read the whole story and tell me what you think!",

If they do decomposition is through aerobic metabolism, and the waste product is carbon dioxide. In a trash heap, the oxygen is quickly used up and the microbes who have metabolism without oxygen take over doing anaerobic decomposition. The byproduct from that process is not carbon dioxide CO2 but methane CH4  otherwise known as natural gas or cow burps. \n\nMolecule for molecule, methane is a far more powerful agent of global warming then carbon dioxide.\n\nSo the message in this post is we can take a huge bite out of emissions if people stop putting compostable organic matter in the trash, where it will be turned mostly to methane, and instead put it in the compost or some collection process where it will be turned into mostly carbon dioxide. \n\n\u201cOn a 100-year timescale, methane has 28 times greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide and is 84 times more potent on a 20-year timescale.\u201d [Source](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/carbon-management-and-fossil-fuels/methane-emissions_en)",

So this is good news in the sense that more ideas and concepts leads to more scalable and effective strategies - but we have to realize the vast majority of these things will amount to absolutely nothing.  \n\nI do think that targeting small amounts of carbon removal from everyday objects is worth looking at though.  It may end up being much more feasible than large expensive facilities.  I\u2019ve often thought that some form of low-energy passive carbon capture in furnaces/air conditioners has potential because we\u2019re already using energy to move the air for other purposes.  But of course, just like with the car, you\u2019ve got to be able to capture, hold, and ultimately sequester the carbon for it to be useful.   And holding/sequestering gets a lot harder at the micro scale.",

                "Content": "Let's see what the paper is about, because the clickbait title sound like clickbait.\n\n>How UA compares with conventional agriculture depends on the crops grown, growing systems and local climate3. It is unclear what forms of UA are environmentally friendly, because case studies of individual cities typically only assess one form of UA\n\nThis just sounds like they're discovering the problem of \"locavore\" footprint. Meaning that eating locally doesn't guarantee lower GHG emissions because the production processes can be more energy intensive or polluting than transportation from a place where those production processes are way less energy intensive and polluting.\n\n>Collective gardens are the most carbon-intensive form of UA (\u03bc\u2009=\u20090.81\u2009kgCO2e per serving, 7.50\u2009kgCO2e\u2009kg\u22121). Individual gardens and urban farms are similar on average (both produce 0.34\u2009kgCO2e per serving), but variation among urban farms leaves them statistically indistinguishable from conventional farms (P\u2009=\u20090.33). In fact, most urban farms are carbon-competitive with conventional farms (median\u2009=\u20090.08\u2009kgCO2e per serving when one particularly carbon-intensive urban farm is excluded from the analysis)\n\nIt's likely a measure of community resource investment with poor planning. Let's see.\n\n>Nonetheless, the average vegetable at the local grocer outperforms the average vegetable on UA sites in all five countries (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nProbably because professionals know how to produce more with less and reach economies of scale. \n\n>For example, the median urban tomato (0.17\u2009kgCO2e per serving) outperforms conventional tomatoes (\u03bc\u2009=\u20090.27\u2009kgCO2e per serving). Although, on average, urban tomatoes are more carbon-intensive than conventional tomatoes (P\u2009=\u20090.02), this low median demonstrates that UA sites often outperform conventional tomato growing. This is largely due to the carbon-intensive greenhouses that supply most tomatoes to our case cities, as well as sub-optimal distribution patterns of the crop from farm to city\n\nif you're growing tomatoes in an open garden, it means that you can grow tomatoes outside and you get free zero-carbon energy from the Sun. Such comparisons should not be made in the first place.\n\n>This suggests that urban food growers could maximize carbon benefits (or minimize carbon impacts) by selecting crops conventionally grown or distributed using carbon-intensive methods. \n\nYes, that's actually the case where transportation emissions are way worse.\n\n> Urban farms are most likely to be climate-friendly (43% of urban farm sites), followed by individual gardens (25% of sites).\n\nthe professionals win. I'm shocked.\n\n>neither environmental actions (for example, presence of solar panels) nor expressed values are predictive of carbon emissions (Supplementary Table 3)\n\nthis isn't a \"fake it till you make it\" situation.\n\n>We identify three best practices crucial to making low-tech UA carbon-competitive with conventional agriculture: (1) extend infrastructure lifetimes, (2) use urban waste as inputs and (3) generate high levels of social benefits.\n\nAll 3 are tied to professional/commercial efforts. Knowing how to build a long-lasting farm is part of a plan. Connecting urban waste and handling it also requires some extra means and know-how. Social benefits means especially that the harvest isn't just for a small minority, which also displaces supply from other sources.\n\n>Infrastructure is the largest driver of carbon emissions at low-tech UA sites (63% of impacts)\n\nYep. You can't use farms like sandboxes.\n\n>The carbon footprint of compost grows tenfold when methane-generating anaerobic conditions persist in compost piles39. This is common during small-scale composting, and home compost is the highest-impact input on 22 of the 73 UA sites studied (Supplementary Table 4). Cities can offset this risk by centralizing compost operations for professional management or by training farmers on proper composting practices\n\nKnowledge. (Otherwise, the compost bin is like the rumen of a cow.) \n\n>Instead, sites primarily used potable municipal water sources or groundwater wells, consistent with the underutilization of rainwater seen across past research9. Irrigation from these sources emits GHGs from pumping, water treatment and distribution, and this rose to as high as 83% of total emissions on one UA site\n\n*points at MULCHING IS OBLIGATORY sign*\n\n>UA practitioners overwhelmingly reported improved mental health, diets and social networks.\n\nIndeed, it's very nice.\n\n>This study takes a conservative approach by allocating all supplies and irrigation to food production, and infrastructure is allocated to food and social co-benefits based on interviews with farmers and standardized calculations (for example, 10% of a raised bed allocated to non-food if 10% of the area grows ornamentals).\n\nThat's fair. The only ornamental plants that should be used are the ones that can be mixed in to help, such as those that attract pollinators, spiders and so on.\n\n>Although this threshold appears high, evidence suggests this is attainable. Cost\u2013benefit analysis of a collective garden in the UK estimated that social benefits, such as improved well-being and reduced hospital admissions, accounted for 99.4% of total economic value generated on-site47. Because emissions allocation often follows economic value generation46, growing spaces that maximize social benefits can outcompete conventional agriculture when UA benefits are considered holistically.\n\nIndeed. They're describing the benefit of a type of park. Don't call it a farm, call it a \"food park\" or \"garden park\". \n\nThis paper is useless, it's not even comparing apples to oranges.",
