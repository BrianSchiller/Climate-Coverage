Ex-President Muhammadu Buhari embarked on a compassionate visit to Borno and Jigawa States on Tuesday to commiserate with the governments and citizens affected by recent calamities.
PUNCH Online reported that the two states recently suffered respective tragic incidents—devastating floods in Borno and a deadly petroleum tanker explosion in Jigawa.
The two tragedies, which cumulatively claimed nearly 200 lives, occurred during Buhari’s time abroad.
This was according to Garba Shehu, Buhari’s former Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, who announced the visits in a statement on Tuesday.
In Borno State, Buhari expressed deep sorrow over the extensive damage, destruction, and significant loss of life caused by the worst flooding the state has experienced in decades.
He attributed the disaster to extreme weather conditions influenced by climate change.
Reflecting on his tenure as the Military Governor of the former North-Eastern state—now divided into six states—he noted, “We used to pray for rain. Now, we face the paradox of overwhelming rainfall causing severe damage.”
Buhari commended both the state and federal authorities for their prompt efforts to restore normalcy and support the affected communities.
Shehu noted that although the former president had previously dispatched a delegation to extend condolences on his behalf, he felt it was essential to visit in person to offer his support.
The state governor, Professor Umara Babagana Zulum, and the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garba Al Amin El-Kanemi, expressed gratitude for the “historic visit.”
They praised Buhari as a leader who had consistently prioritised the region and brought transformative projects.
“Without the 85-megawatt power plant you commissioned, Maiduguri would have remained in darkness.
“You established the North East Development Commission, a military university, a federal polytechnic, and a college of education.
“You also played a crucial role in restoring peace after years of Boko Haram insurgency,” Zulum highlighted.
In Jigawa State, Buhari was received by Acting Governor, Aminu Usman, who guided him through Rasheed Shekoni University Teaching Hospital, where survivors of the tanker explosion were receiving treatment.
Buhari joined the community in prayers for the repose of over 180 victims who lost their lives and wished a swift recovery for those still hospitalised.
The acting governor expressed profound appreciation for Buhari’s empathetic visit and financial assistance to the victims, reinforcing the former president’s enduring connection to the people of Jigawa.
PUNCH Online reported in September that at least 414,000 people have been displaced and another 30 killed by the devastating flood in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.
Meanwhile, in mid-October, PUNCH Online also reported that a total of 167 persons had so far lost their lives following a fuel tanker explosion in Majiya town in the Taura Local Government Area of Jigawa State.
