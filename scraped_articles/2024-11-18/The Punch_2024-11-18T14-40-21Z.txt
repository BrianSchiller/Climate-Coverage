The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Renewable Energy, Mr Afam Ogene, has called for accessible and equitable policies, including tax breaks and vocational grants, to empower youth in renewable energy in Africa, particularly Nigeria.
Ogene, who represents Ogbaru Federal Constituency, Anambra State, made the call on Monday alongside other stakeholders at a side event co-hosted by the Committee on Renewable Energy and a Netherlands-based knowledge platform, INCLUDE, at the ongoing Conference of Parties, COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, where world leaders gathered to discuss climate change issues.
The lawmaker also advocated the inclusion of youths and legislators in conferences and workshops where issues involving policies on climate change and energy transition are discussed.
According to a statement signed by Ogene and the Executive Director, INCLUDE, Anika Altaf, the side event, “Driving the Just Transition: Labour-Based Incentives and Youth-Centric Policies for a Sustainable Future,” focused on practical ways to promote an equitable and inclusive transition to renewable energy in Africa.
Speakers at the side event included Ogene, Dr Altaf, Victoria Manya, Knowledge Broker (INCLUDE), Nurgul Iliazova, Professor of Economics, Bishkek State University, Kazakhstan, Farida Ally, Kenyan youth leader, Solomon Abu, a nuclear scientist, and Kgaugelo Mkumbeni, research officer, Institute for Security Studies, Kenya.
In her presentation, Altaf recommended mentorship programmes and international funding to support youth-led renewable energy projects.
The statement said, “Victoria Manya set the scene for the panel’s conversation predicated on three critical points Africa has pressing needs, like job creation and energy access, to address energy poverty; Africa contributes less than 4% of global emissions, so our transition must prioritize fair, localized strategies. For this transition to truly benefit Africa, we must base it on labour incentives that empower youth to take the lead.
“The event underscored the importance of crafting policies that resonate with young people. This involves using youth-friendly language, actively involving young voices in policy formulation, and prioritising initiatives that align with their aspirations, such as meaningful, skill-based employment opportunities in the renewable energy sector.”
The statement noted that speakers agreed that young people are emerging as key contributors to renewable energy solutions tailored to their communities.
“These innovations are not only effective but scalable, demonstrating the transformative potential of youth-led technological advancements in combating climate change,” it added.
The session called for partnerships between governments, educational institutions, and private sector actors to develop and implement targeted technical and vocational training.
A critical theme in the conversation was ensuring that vulnerable and marginalised communities are not left behind in the renewable energy transition.
Global and Regional Collaboration International organisations and regional stakeholders were urged to provide authentic support for youth-led initiatives.
These include mentorship programmes, direct funding for grassroots projects, and platforms for cross-sector collaboration that prioritize local solutions.
The event concluded with a call for turning discussions into actionable frameworks, including piloting labour-based incentives, integrating youth-focused priorities into national renewable energy policies, and leveraging global forums such as COP 2024 to amplify Africa’s voice in the energy transition.
Participants unanimously urged international organisations and regional stakeholders to provide authentic support for youth-led initiatives. This includes mentorship programmes, direct funding for grassroots projects, and platforms for cross-sector collaboration that prioritise local solutions.
