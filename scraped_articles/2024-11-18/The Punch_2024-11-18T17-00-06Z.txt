The G20 summit kicked off on Monday with a major initiative led by Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who announced the creation of a global alliance to combat hunger and poverty.
The pact, backed by over 80 countries, aims to coordinate efforts worldwide to address these pressing issues.
Lula’s proposal has gained the support of key international organisations, including the African Union, European Union, development banks, and philanthropic foundations like the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Lula, who addressed the summit at Rio de Janeiro’s Modern Art Museum underscored the urgent need to tackle poverty and climate change, as he pointed out that hunger was not a result of a lack of resources but caused by political decisions.
He said the current situation is unacceptable given the world’s capacity to produce nearly 6 billion tons of food annually.
“Hunger and poverty are not the result of scarcity or natural phenomena … they are the product of political decisions,” he said as reported by Reuters.
The two-day summit came at a time of shifting global dynamics, particularly as the United States president-elect Donald Trump prepares to assume office in January 2025.
Trump’s anticipated policies, ranging from new tariffs to a potential diplomatic approach to the Ukraine conflict, are expected to influence discussions on trade, climate action and international security during the summit.
Diplomatic tensions over the Ukraine war have already affected negotiations for a joint summit statement. However, European diplomats pushed for stronger language following a significant Russian air strike on Ukraine just before the summit.
The conflict has posed challenges to maintaining a unified stance, with Russia represented at the event by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in place of President Vladimir Putin.
Security was heightened across Rio de Janeiro for the summit, with troops reinforcing local police. Hours before the meeting began, a Brazilian army patrol was fired upon near the Cidade de Deus community, but no injuries were reported.
According to Reuters, as US President Joe Biden, who is nearing the end of his term, joined the summit, he focused on sustainability and development aid.
Biden announced plans to boost the World Bank’s International Development Association fund, targeting the world’s poorest countries, and launched a new clean energy partnership with Brazil.
However, Lula’s agenda, emphasising poverty reduction and taxing the super-rich, may face obstacles when Trump takes office, as his administration is expected to prioritise different economic policies.
China’s President Xi Jinping, another central figure at the summit, advocated for increased support to developing countries and promoted the Belt and Road Initiative, a major infrastructure project.
China’s economic influence remains significant, although Brazil has not yet joined the initiative, leading to disappointment in Beijing.
Nonetheless, hopes for further industrial partnerships remain as Xi plans to visit Brasilia following the summit.
