On this year’s list, TIME editors write: Around the world, decision makers, executives, researchers, and innovators are working to help unlock the necessary funding and resources needed to drive successful and equitable climate action…To identify this year’s changemakers, TIME’s editors spent months vetting names from across the economy. We valued measurable, scalable achievements over commitments and announcements. We favored more recent action. The result is our second annual TIME100 Climate list which represents multitudes of individuals making significant progress in influencing the business of climate change. We asked them to talk about it, hoping their words will stir others to do the same.” https://bit.ly/3UGikk3
