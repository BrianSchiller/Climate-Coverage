The Minister of Innovation, Science, and Technology, Chief Uche Nnaji, has reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to driving innovation and strengthening global scientific collaboration.
He disclosed this in a statement from the Director of Media and Corporate Communications at the National Space Research and Development Agency, Dr. Felix Ale, on Monday.
In his keynote speech marking World Science Day for Peace and Development in Abuja, the minister underscored the crucial role of science and technology in fostering sustainable development and global well-being.
Nnaji stressed the indispensable role of science in shaping a progressive society, particularly in today’s interconnected world.
“Science improves lives and drives growth across multiple sectors within Nigeria,” he declared.
“As we strengthen our role in the global STI network, Nigeria aims not only to contribute to but also to benefit from international scientific advancements for sustainable development,” he added.
He noted that the theme for this year’s observance, “Global Science for Global Well-being,” highlights the critical need for international cooperation to tackle pressing global challenges such as health crises, food insecurity, and climate change.
Reflecting on these challenges, Nnaji emphasised the interconnectedness of the world.
“The world is a community, interconnected in countless ways. Only by breaking down barriers and working together can we effectively tackle global challenges like pandemics, food scarcity, and natural disasters,” he noted.
In his address, the Minister also drew lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscored the importance of scientific collaboration.
“The pandemic demonstrated the urgent need for scientific collaboration. We must foster partnerships early, not as a response to crises but as a proactive strategy for resilience and growth,” he noted.
Nnaji reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to expanding these partnerships, ensuring that science and innovation play a central role across all sectors of the economy, from healthcare to agriculture, energy, and beyond.
One of the highlights of the event was the Minister’s focus on Nigeria’s growing international collaborations in cutting-edge technologies. With over 22 international partnerships, he said Nigeria is advancing in fields such as Green Hydrogen, tech city development, cloud computing, and drone technology for agriculture and security.
These collaborations, Nnaji explained, bring invaluable resources such as scholarships, educational tools, and training opportunities that significantly enhance Nigeria’s scientific and technological capacity.
The minister also addressed the importance of investing in Nigeria’s youth, emphasising the need to inspire and empower the next generation of innovators.
“We are investing in the future by building capacity among our youth, students, and innovators, particularly encouraging girls and young women to pursue careers in science and technology,” he said.
He pointed to the Indigenous Modular Refinery Training Programme as a key example of how the Ministry is nurturing innovation with real-world applications, helping to strengthen Nigeria’s industrial and technological landscape.
This year’s World Science Day celebration also featured exhibitions and a science quiz competition for secondary school students, designed to spark interest in science and innovation among Nigeria’s youth.
The Minister encouraged all students to embrace the opportunities offered by the STEM fields, noting that “the future of Nigeria’s scientific and technological success depends on the passion and creativity of today’s students.”
Looking forward, Nnaji reiterated the Ministry’s commitment to deepening research and development collaborations, both locally and globally.
“Our goal is to align Nigeria’s cultural and work ethics with modern entrepreneurial, scientific, and technological aspirations. We are committed to ensuring Nigeria’s active participation in international STI networks,” he stated.
The minister expressed optimism for the future, highlighting the potential of science and innovation to create a more peaceful and prosperous world.
“May our work today inspire a future defined by knowledge, innovation, and shared progress,” he said.
