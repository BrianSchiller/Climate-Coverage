Forests are often called the lungs of our planet, absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and playing a crucial role in regulating the climate. But what happens when mining operations carve through these vital ecosystems?
A recent study conducted by researchers Avinash Kumar Ranjan and Prof. Amit Kumar Gorai of the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, sheds light on this pressing issue, revealing via satellite datasets that mining activities cleared an area of forest almost the size of Kuwait or Eswatini country between 2000 and 2019.
This deforestation has not only released massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere but also weakened the planet's ability to combat climate change .
The findings, published in the Journal of Environmental Management , raise urgent questions: How can we balance the demand for minerals with the need to protect forests? And what steps must be taken to prevent further environmental damage ?
The research estimated that globally 16,785 km 2 mining-induced deforestation has led to the release of approximately 490 million tons of CO₂, almost equivalent to Brazil's or more than Australia's and South Africa's annual emissions in 2023. Furthermore, this deforestation has reduced the planet's ability to absorb carbon by 36 million tons annually, an amount that offsets the emissions of 8 million cars each year.
Forests are natural "climate shields" that absorb harmful CO₂, regulate weather and support countless species. The loss of forest cover not only affects local ecosystems but also reduces the Earth's natural capacity to sequester carbon, contributing to a rise in atmospheric CO₂ levels. The study highlights that mining-related deforestation is concentrated in some of the world's most vital ecosystems, including:
Africa, South America and Australia also reported significant forest losses, harming ecosystems and communities that rely on forests for their livelihoods. See figure 2 and figure 3 for country and continent-wise forest cover loss and subsequent CO 2 emission statistics.
The study further highlights that mining activities have disproportionately affected forest land in certain countries between 2000 and 2019. Suriname, Guyana, Armenia, New Caledonia, Ghana and Peru saw a particularly high percentage of their total forest loss linked to mining.
This finding stresses the urgent need for policies to minimize mining's environmental impact and protect forests. In places like Suriname and Guyana, where mining-related forest loss is especially alarming, sustainable practices and stronger conservation efforts are crucial to safeguard these vital ecosystems.
The authors further emphasize that these estimates are limited to areas with forest heights of 5 meters, as shorter vegetation was not included. "If we consider all vegetation types, these figures for forest cover loss, carbon emissions and carbon sequestration loss would be significantly higher," noted researcher Ranjan. This limitation suggests that the true extent of mining's environmental impact could be significantly greater, underscoring the urgency of addressing the issue.
When forests are cut down, the stored carbon in trees is released, contributing to climate change. Worse, the planet loses a key tool to absorb CO₂ in the future. The CO₂ emissions from mining-induced deforestation could derail global efforts to combat climate change, including the COP26 pledge to halt deforestation by 2030.
"Mining is often overlooked as a cause of deforestation," said Prof. Gorai. "Yet it's clear that the environmental cost is enormous—both locally and globally." Prof. Gorai added, "The climate impact is global, and as our study shows, regions rich in biodiversity and carbon storage are under immense threat."
The researchers emphasize that it's not too late to act. Governments, NGOs, businesses, and communities must:
"Mining doesn't have to come at the cost of forests," said researcher Ranjan. "With sustainable practices and global cooperation, we can protect these vital ecosystems while meeting resource demands. Mining activities in densely forested areas have compounded the issue of deforestation, worsening the climate crisis by releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere. These losses are particularly concerning as they come from some of the world's most biodiverse and carbon-rich forests, like those in the Amazon and Southeast Asia."
The researchers hope that their work will inform policy decisions and inspire global efforts to balance resource extraction with environmental sustainability. This study is a wake-up call to rethink how mining affects our planet. While resources are essential, preserving forests is equally critical to safeguarding the climate, biodiversity and communities worldwide.
