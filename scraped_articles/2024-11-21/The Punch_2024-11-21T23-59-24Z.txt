Residents of Victoria Garden City, Lagos, have planted 300 trees as part of efforts to promote environmental sustainability and combat the effects of climate change in commemoration of its 30th anniversary.
In a statement, VGC, a residential and commercial estate along the Lekki-Epe Expressway in Eti-Osa Local Government Area, noted its estate boasts over 3,800 trees, which residents see as central to its identity.
The Chairman of the VGC Property Owners and Resident Association, Lola Bolarinwa, highlighted the importance of tree planting in maintaining the estate’s greenery and ensuring environmental consciousness.
Bolarinwa remarked, “VGC turned 30 on November 16. As a community, we are very big on greenery. We pride ourselves as a paradise by the lagoon.”
She explained that many of the estate’s original trees, some over three decades old, had become problematic, with roots damaging pavements and walkways.
“To celebrate this anniversary, we planted 300 trees to replace those that were cut down or lost during storms. We are an environmentally friendly community and believe in the importance of replanting for the future,” she added.
Residents also planted trees in memory of loved ones, underscoring the community’s inclusivity and dedication to preserving its heritage.
Founder of FABE Foundation and chairperson of the tree-planting committee, Temitope Okunnu, described the exercise as critical to maintaining VGC’s legacy, noting “If we do not replant these trees, we would lose the essence of VGC as a garden city. This is our way of addressing the climate crisis and ensuring continuity.”
Other key figures who supported the initiative include Peter Brittain of the VGC Facility Maintenance Management Committee, who described tree planting as core to the estate’s sustainability goals.
According to Brittain, “This is part of promoting environmental sustainability and mitigating climate change effects. The residents are committed to maintaining the estate’s unique ambiance.”
A former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Joseph Sanusi, stressed the importance of preserving VGC for future generations, declaring “Planting trees ensures that this beautiful and secure environment remains for generations yet to come.”
Meanwhile, a resident, Olajumoke Bakare, who planted a tree in memory of her late husband, noted that the initiative was a meaningful way to immortalise loved ones while contributing to the estate’s greenery.
“Planting a tree increases oxygen in the air and enhances the beauty of the estate,” Bakare remarked.
The event also saw participation from federal lawmaker Achief Thaddeus, who praised the community’s efforts to sustain its greenery legacy. “We are planting trees to mitigate climate change and maintain the estate’s identity,” he said.
