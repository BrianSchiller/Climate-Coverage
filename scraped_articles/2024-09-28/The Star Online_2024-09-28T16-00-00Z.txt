PUTRAJAYA: Climate change is one of the factors affecting the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes in the country, says Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad.
He said Aedes mosquitoes breed actively when there is a change in temperature.
“Sand traps and rooftops that don’t meet public health requirements can both be breeding grounds for Aedes mosquitoes.
“These structural factors play a significant role in the mosquito population,” he said after the Gotong Royong Mega Fight Aedes 2.0, 1 Hour Malaysia Clean Up and Malaysia Clean Up programme here yesterday.
On Friday, the Health Ministry reported that weather conditions play an important role in the transmission of dengue fever because they affect the habitat and survival of the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
According to the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia), the monsoon transition phase began on Sept 24 and is expected to continue until November, Bernama reported.
Until the 38th Epidemiological Week (ME38) from Sept 15-21, the ministry reported that there were 1,514 cases of dengue fever including two deaths.
Dzulkefly said the ministry will strengthen dengue prevention and control activities through district health offices, health clinics and the Communication for Behaviour Change (Combi) volunteer team.
Among the activities carried out by the ministry with the cooperation of various agencies are vector control monitoring and inspection of Aedes mosquito breeding grounds.
