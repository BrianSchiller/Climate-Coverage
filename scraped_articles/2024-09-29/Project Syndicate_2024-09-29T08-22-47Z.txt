For Japan’s new 67-year-old prime minister, ascending to the post is the realization of a long-held dream. But his political star will likely soon fall – perhaps rapidly – owing both to policy weaknesses and questionable management skills.

Since the ruling party holds a majority in the National Diet (parliament), Ishiba will be Japan’s next prime minister. For the 67-year-old Ishiba, long a leading rival of the late Abe Shinzō , ascending to the post is the realization of a long-held dream. But Ishiba’s political star will likely soon fall – perhaps rapidly.
