Sterling One Foundation has expanded its Beach Adoption Programme, a climate initiative focused on waste recovery and marine pollution reduction, in the aftermath of the COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan held recently.
The announcement was made in a statement issued on Friday.
The COP29, or the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference held from November 11–22, 2024 brought together nearly 200 countries to discuss climate change and make decisions.
The Chief Executive Officer of Sterling One Foundation, Olapeju Ibekwe, described the Beach Adoption Programme as a significant local response to global environmental challenges.
“COP29 reaffirmed the importance of solutions that empower communities while driving sustainability. The Beach Adoption Programme is one of our ways of translating those principles into action,” she said.
The expansion follows COP29’s emphasis on community-driven initiatives and nature-based solutions as critical tools for combating climate change. The programme, supported by partners including First E&P, Bonnie Bio, LAWMA, Rite Foods, Sterling Bank, and the African Cleanup Initiative, has become a model for public-private collaboration.
The program, launched in 2021, now includes three additional beaches in Lagos—Debojo Beach, Eleko; Badore Beach, Ajah; and Okun Mopo Beach, Ajah. These additions align with Lagos State’s Climate Action Plan and global climate priorities emphasised at COP29, which highlighted the importance of localised action and public-private partnerships in addressing climate challenges.
Lagos State Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources Tokunbo Wahab praised the initiative, saying, “Partnerships like this demonstrate how environmental goals can be achieved through collaboration. By integrating circular economy practices, Sterling One Foundation is creating both environmental and economic value.”
The Beach Adoption Programme has recorded significant milestones, collecting over 7,800kg of solid waste and 4,900kg of recyclables from beaches such as Alpha Beach, Eleko Beach, and Lafiaji Beach.
The programme also includes climate education efforts, having engaged over 5,000 students across Nigeria to raise awareness about sustainability and waste management.
Apart from this, the programme has built the capacity of the locals to take responsibility for their environment with the tools and the education needed to become active players in the circular economy while reducing plastic pollution on our beaches.
It has also supported the livelihood of women and youth in these communities giving them an alternative source of income.
Sterling One Foundation plans to continue expanding the programme working with various partners while strengthening its focus on circular economy practices, contributing to Nigeria’s climate goals and global sustainability efforts.
