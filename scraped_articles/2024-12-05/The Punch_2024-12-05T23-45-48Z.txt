In what has been widely described as an impactful service dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable populations, the Global Village Healthcare Initiative for Africa celebrates a decade of active service in Nigeria.
In a press statement issued by the organisation’s Executive Director, Mulikat Bamidele, she stated that the organisation is marking its tenth anniversary of active service in Nigeria, even as
Arewa PUNCH reports that the celebration week started on Sunday.
Bamidele indicated that its activities began as a grassroots health outreach in Ogundele, Ilorin West, Kwara State, and have since evolved into a comprehensive humanitarian organisation addressing healthcare, education, nutrition, WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), protection, livelihoods, and food security.
Founded by Jude Shagba between 2013 and 2015, GHIV Africa emerged from a desire to tackle urgent healthcare challenges in underserved communities. Over the past decade, the organisation has consistently championed equitable healthcare access, community support, and sustainable development through dynamic partnerships with local and international organisations.
The statement read in parts, “Since 2019, GHIV Africa has expanded its operations nationwide, reaching conflict-affected regions in North-East Nigeria while maintaining its core initiatives across the North-Central and South-West regions.
“Through partnerships with Oxfam, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the International Organisation for Migration, and the International Rescue Committee, GHIV Africa has achieved remarkable milestones in providing nutrition interventions for over 40,000 children under five, indirectly impacting an additional 120,000 individuals. The organisation also delivered sexual and reproductive health support to 25,000 women and girls.
“Furthermore, GHIV Africa ensured educational opportunities for 25,000 out-of-school children, benefiting an estimated 60,000 community members indirectly. The organisation provided WASH services to 45,000 conflict-affected people, with over 100,000 benefiting indirectly,” the statement added.
Additionally, it noted that “The organisation has supported 12,000 women and girls through interventions for gender-based violence. It has assisted over 5,000 individuals with cash aid and provided mental health and psychosocial support to 15,000 children. Moreover, GHIV Africa enhanced access to education and essential services for 450 children with disabilities.”
Building on its momentum, GHIV Africa added, “We are set to embark on an ambitious new chapter beginning from January 2025, and launching a three-year education initiative funded by Education Cannot Wait. This program aims to address the critical needs of out-of-school children in the northeastern states of Nigeria: Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe.
“The initiative reflects GHIV Africa’s commitment to ensuring that every child has access to quality education, particularly in regions affected by conflict and instability.
“As GHIV Africa looks to the future, its strategic goals over the next ten years are focused on several key areas:
“GHIV Africa aims to integrate climate-smart agriculture and environmental sustainability into its programs. This includes promoting practices that enhance community resilience to climate change, ensuring that agricultural methods are sustainable and beneficial to the environment.
“The organisation is committed to strengthening its research focus on critical public health issues, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other emerging health threats. This will involve innovations in health interventions and partnerships that enhance the effectiveness of healthcare delivery in underserved communities.
“GHIV Africa plans to broaden its health and education services, specifically targeting underserved populations in rural and conflict-affected areas. This includes not only direct services but also efforts to improve infrastructure and accessibility to these essential services,” the statement added.
While also recognising the importance of building local capacity, GHIV Africa has prioritised its six-month intensive internship program, noting that, “Since our inception in 2022, the program has successfully equipped over 2,000 graduates and professionals with practical experience in the humanitarian and development sectors. This focus on training and capacity building will continue, ensuring that local talent is developed and retained.
“Under its leadership and collaborative efforts, GHIV Africa has played a pivotal role in sector coordination and advisory groups, contributing to strategic advisory initiatives in education and nutrition,” it noted further.
Our correspondent affirmed that the organisation has also held leadership positions within partnerships involving the World Food Programme, along with disability inclusion and cash working groups. GHIV Africa has been instrumental in drafting key strategic documents across multiple sectors.
“As GHIV Africa celebrates its achievements, it extends heartfelt gratitude to its donors, partners, and the communities it serves. With strengthened partnerships and the initiation of new collaborations, GHIV Africa is well-positioned to expand its reach and deliver transformative programs that foster resilience and sustainable development for millions of individuals,” the statement concluded.
