Schneider Electric has reiterated its commitment to tackling Nigeria’s food security and climate challenges through advanced energy and automation solutions.
The company emphasised its efforts at the Nigerian Society of Engineers Conference held recently in Lagos.
In a statement on Friday, the Country President of Schneider Electric, Ajibola Akindele, said the company’s technologies play a vital role in creating resilient systems to boost food production, conserve resources, and address climate change impacts.
“At Schneider Electric, we recognise the interconnectedness of climate action and food security. Through our innovative energy and automation solutions, we are helping to build resilient systems that drive food production, conserve resources, and mitigate the effects of climate change,” he said.
The NSE conference, which brought together engineers, policymakers, and industry leaders, focused on the theme “Sustainable Engineering Solutions to Food Security and Climate Change”.
The firm said its initiatives aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).
It also revealed ongoing projects, such as solar-powered mini-grids and energy-efficient food processing solutions, were already driving tangible impact.
These initiatives directly benefit farmers and small-scale enterprises, supporting Nigeria’s food security goals while advancing the fight against climate change, the company said.
The Marketing Communications Manager, Anglophone Africa, Schneider Electric, Omobolanle Omotayo, highlighted the critical role of skill development in sustaining their sustainability initiatives.
“We have created training programmes through collaborations with NGOs, academic institutions, and other stakeholders, dedicated to equipping engineers and technicians with skills in sustainable practices.
“This programme contributes to building a skilled workforce that can develop and maintain energy-efficient systems, particularly in underserved communities,” Omotayo remarked.
