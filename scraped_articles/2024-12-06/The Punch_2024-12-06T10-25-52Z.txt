The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by 60% by 2031, with an overarching goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2060.
According to the NNPC on its X platform, this is a bold step towards combating climate change, which aligns with the nation’s leadership role in Africa under the Global Methane Pledge initiative.
Speaking on Thursday, the Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, highlighted ongoing efforts to meet these targets during a meeting with the U.S. State Department’s Global Methane Program Manager, Robert Leahman, and a team from Deloitte.
“Reducing methane emissions is not just an environmental necessity but also a strategic imperative for Nigeria’s energy transition. We are leveraging partnerships to adopt global best practices and innovative solutions,” Kyari stated during a meeting at the NNPC Towers in Abuja.
The meeting centred on collaborative methane abatement initiatives, including a pilot project in the Niger Delta. The project aims to establish emissions baselines, mitigate methane leaks, and promote sustainable practices across Nigeria’s energy operations.
Leahman commended Nigeria’s proactive approach, emphasising the global impact of such efforts.
“Nigeria’s leadership under the Global Methane Pledge sets a standard for the continent. These initiatives will not only help reduce emissions but also drive sustainable development in the energy sector,” he noted.
The pilot project is a joint effort between NNPC, Deloitte, and the U.S. Bureau of Energy Resources. It aims to implement data-driven methodologies to identify and address methane hotspots, further aligning with Nigeria’s ambitious environmental objectives.
Kyari reiterated the significance of the initiative in achieving the nation’s climate goals.
“This collaboration is a game-changer. By addressing methane leaks, we’re reducing waste, saving costs, and protecting the environment. It’s a win-win for our economy and the planet,” he added.
